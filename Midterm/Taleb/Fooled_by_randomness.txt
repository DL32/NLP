                    TAKING KNOWLEDGE LESS SERIOUSLY

       This book is the synthesis of, on one hand, the no-nonsense prac­
       titioner of uncertainty who spent his professional life trying to
       resist being fooled by randomness and trick the emotions as-
sociated with probabilistic outcomes and, on the other, the aestheti­
cally obsessed, literature-loving human being willing to be fooled by
any form of nonsense that is polished, refined, original, and tasteful.I
am not capable of avoiding being the fool of randomness;what I can
do is confine it to where it brings some aesthetic gratification.
   This comes straight from the gut; it is a personal essay primarily
discussing its author's thoughts, struggles, and observations con­
nected to the practice of risk taking, not exactly a treatise, and cer­
tainly, god forbid, not a piece of scientific reporting.It was written
for fun and it aims to be read (principally) for, and with, pleasure.
Much has been written about our biases (acquired or genetic) in
dealing with randomness over the past decade. The rules while
writing the first edition of this book had been to avoid discussing
(a) anything that I did not either personally witness on the topic
or develop independently, and (b) anything that I have not dis­
tilled well enough to be able to write on the subject with only the
slightest effort. Everything that remotely felt like work was out.I
had to purge from the text passages that seemed to come from a
visit to the library, including the scientific name dropping. I tried
to use no quote that did not naturally spring from my memory and
did not come from a writer whom I had intimately frequented
over the years (I detest the practice of random use of borrowed
wisdom-much on that later).Aut tace aut loquere meliora silencio
(only when the words outperform silence).
   These rules remain intact.But sometimes life requires compro­
mises: Under pressure from friends and readers I have added to
the present edition a series of nonintrusive endnotes referring to
the related literature. I have also added new material to most
chapters, most notably in Chapter 11, which altogether has re­
sulted in an expansion of the book by more than a third.

                       Adding to the Winner
I hope to make this book organic-by, to use traders' lingo, "adding
to the winner"-and let it reflect my personal evolution instead of
holding on to these new ideas and putting them into a new book
altogether. Strangely, I gave considerably more thought to some
sections of this book after the publication than I had before, par­
ticularly in two separate areas: (a) the mechanisms by which our
brain sees the world as less, far less, random that it actually is, and
(b) the "fat tails," that wild brand of uncertainty that causes large
deviations (rare events explain more and more of the world we
live in, but at the same time remain as counterintuitive to us as
they were to our ancestors). The second version of this book re­
flects this author's drift into becoming a little less of a student of
uncertainty (we can learn so little about randomness) and more of
a researcher into how people are fooled by it.
   Another phenomenon: the transformation of the author by his
own book.As I increasingly started living this book after the initial
composition, I found luck in the most unexpected of places. It is
as if there were two planets: the one in which we actually live and
the one, considerably more deterministic, on which people are
convinced we live.It is as simple as that: Past events will always
look less random than they were (it is called the hindsight bias). I
would listen to someone's discussion of his own past realizing that
much of what he was saying was just backfit explanations con­
cocted ex post by his deluded mind. This became at times un­
bearable: I could feel myself looking at people in the social
sciences (particularly conventional economics) and the invest­
ment world as if they were deranged subjects. Living in the real
world may be painful particularly if one finds statements more in­
formative about the people making them than the intended mes­
sage: I picked up Newsweek this morning at the dentist's office and
read a journalist's discussion of a prominent business figure, par­
ticularly his ability in "timing moves " and realized how I was mak­
ing a list of the biases in the journalist's mind rather than getting
the intended information in the article itself, which I could not
possibly take seriously. (Why don't most journalists end up figur­
ing out that they know much less than they think they know? Sci­
entists investigated half a century ago the phenomena of "experts "
not learning about their past failings.You can mispredict every­
thing for all your life yet think that you will get it right next time.)

                     Insecurity and Probability
I believe that the principal asset I need to protect and cultivate is
my deep-seated intellectual insecurity. My motto is " my principal
activity is to tease those who take themselves and the quality of their
knowledge too seriously." Cultivating such insecurity in place of in­
tellectual confidence may be a strange aim-and one that is not
easy to implement.To do so we need to purge our minds of the re­
cent tradition of intellectual certainties.A reader turned pen pal
made me rediscover the sixteenth-century French essayist and
professional introspector Montaigne. I got sucked into the impli­
cations of the difference between Montaigne and Descartes-and
how we strayed by following the latter's quest for certitudes. We
surely closed our minds by following Descartes' model of formal
thinking rather than Montaigne's brand of vague and informal
(but critical) judgment. Half a millennium later the severely in­
trospecting and insecure Montaigne stands tall as a role model for
the modern thinker. In addition, the man had exceptional courage:
It certainly takes bravery to remain skeptical; it takes inordinate
courage to introspect, to confront oneself, to accept one's limita­
tions-scientists are seeing more and more evidence that we are
specifically designed by mother nature to fool ourselves.
   There are many intellectual approaches to probability and.
risk-"probability" means slightly different things to people in dif­
ferent disciplines. In this book it is tenaciously qualitative and lit­
erary as opposed to quantitative and "scientific" (which explains
the warnings against economists and finance professors as they
tend to firmly believe that they know something, and something
useful at that) .It is presented as flowing from Hume's Problem of
Induction (or Aristotle's inference to the general) as opposed to
the paradigm of the gambling literature.In this book probability is
principally a branch of applied skepticism, not an engineering dis­
cipline (in spite of all the self-important mathematical treatment
of the subject matter, problems related to the calculus of proba­
bility rarely merit to transcend the footnote) .
   How? Probability is not a mere computation of odds on the
dice or more complicated variants; it is the acceptance of the lack
of certainty in our knowledge and the development of methods for
dealing with our ignorance. Outside of textbooks and casinos, prob­
ability almost never presents itself as a mathematical problem or a
brain teaser. Mother nature does not tell you how many holes
there are on the roulette table, nor does she deliver problems in a
textbook way (in the real world one has to guess the problem
more than the solution) .In this book, considering that alternative
outcomes could have taken place, that the world could have been
different, is the core of probabilistic thinking.As a matter of fact,
I spent all my career attacking the quantitative use of probability.
While Chapters 13 and 14 (dealing with skepticism and stoicism)
are to me the central ideas of the book, most people focused on
the examples of miscomputation of probability in Chapter 11
(clearly and by far the least original chapter of the book, one in
which I compressed all the literature on probability biases) .In ad­
dition, while we may have some understanding of the probabili­
ties in the hard sciences, particularly in physics, we don't have
much of a clue in the social "sciences " like economics, in spite of
the fanfares of experts.

                   Vindicating (Some) Readers
I have tried to make the minimum out of my occupation of math­
ematical trader.The fact that I operate in the markets serves only
as an inspiration-it does not make this book (as many thought it
was) a guide to market randomness any more than the Iliad should
be interpreted as a military instruction manual. Only three out of
fourteen chapters have a financial setting. Markets are a mere spe­
cial case of randomness traps-but they are by far the most inter­
esting as luck plays a very large role in them (this book would have
been considerably shorter if I were a taxidermist or a translator of
chocolate labels) .Furthermore, the kind of luck in finance is of the
kind that nobody understands but most operators think they un­
derstand, which provides us a magnification of the biases. I have
tried to use my market analogies in an illustrative way as I would
in a dinner conversation with, say, a cardiologist with intellectual
curiosity (I used as a model my second-generation friend Jacques
Merab) .
   I received large quantities of electronic mail on the first version
of the book, which can be an essayist's dream as such dialectic
provides ideal conditions for the rewriting of the second version. I
expressed my gratitude by answering (once) each one of them.
Some of the answers have been inserted back into the text in the
different chapters. Being often seen as an iconoclast I was looking
forward to getting the angry letters of the type "who are you to
judge Warren Buffett" or "you are envious of his success "; instead
it was disappointing to see most of the trashing going anony­
mously to amazon.com (there is no such thing as bad publicity:
Some people manage to promote your work by insulting it) .
   The consolation for the lack of attacks was in the form of letters
from people who felt vindicated by the book.The most rewarding
letters were the ones from people who did not fare well in life,
through no fault of their own, who used the book as an argument
with their spouse to explain that they were less lucky (not less
skilled) than their brother-in-law. The most touching letter came
from a man in Virginia who within a period of a few months lost
his job, his wife, his fortune, was put under investigation by the re­
doubtable Securities and Exchange Commission, and progressively
felt good for acting stoically. A correspondence with a reader who
was hit with a black swan, the unexpected large-impact random
event (the loss of a baby) caused me to spend some time dipping
into the literature on adaptation after a severe random event (not
coincidentally also dominated by Daniel Kahneman, the pioneer of
the ideas on irrational behavior under uncertainty) . I have to con­
fess that I never felt really particularly directly of service to anyone
being a trader (except myself); it felt elevating and useful being an
essayist.

                             All or None
A few confusions with the message in this book.Just as our brain
does not easily make out probabilistic shades (it goes for the over­
simplifying "all-or-none ") , it was hard to explain that the idea here
was that "it is more random than we think" rather than "it is all ran­
dom." I had to face the "Taleb, as a skeptic, thinks everything is ran­
dom and successful people are just lucky. " The Fooled by
Randomness symptom even affected a well-publicized Cambridge
                           PREl=ACE     xiii

Union Debate as my argument "Most City Hotshots are Lucky
Fools " became "All City Hotshots are Lucky Fools" (clearly I lost
the debate to the formidable Desmond Fitzgerald in one of the
most entertaining discussions in my life-I was even tempted to
switch sides!) .The same delusion of mistaking irreverence for ar­
rogance ( as I noticed with my message) makes people confuse
skepticism for nihilism.
   Let me make it clear here: Of course chance favors the pre­
pared] Hard work, showing up on time, wearing a clean (prefer­
ably white) shirt, using deodorant, and some such conventional
things contribute to success-they are certainly necessary but may
be insufficient as they do not cause success.The same applies to
the conventional values of persistence, doggedness and persever­
ance: necessary, very necessary. One needs to go out and buy a lot­
tery ticket in order to win.Does it mean that the work involved in
the trip to the store caused the winning? Of course skills count,
but they do count less in highly random environments than they
do in dentistry.
   No, I am no! saying that what your grandmother told you about
the value of work ethics is wrong! Furthermore, as most successes
are caused by very few "windows of opportunity, " failing to grab
one can be deadly for one's career.Take your luck!
   Notice how our brain sometimes gets the arrow of causality
backward. Assume that good qualities cause success; based on that
assumption, even though it seems intuitively correct to think so,
the fact that every intelligent, hardworking, persevering person
becomes successful does not imply that every successful person is
necessarily an intelligent, hardworking, persevering person (it is
remarkable how such a primitive logical fallacy-affirming the con­
sequent--can be made by otherwise very intelligent people, a point
I discuss in this edition as the "two systems of reasoning " problem) .
   There is a twist in research on success that has found its way
into the bookstores under the banner of advice on: "these are the
                            xiv   PREl=ACE


millionaires' traits that you need to have if you want to be just like
those successful people." One of the authors of the misguided The
Millionaire Next Door (that I discuss in Chapter 8) wrote another
even more foolish book called The Millionaire Mind. He observes
that in the representative cohort of more than a thousand million­
aires whom he studied most did not exhibit high intelligence in
their childhood and infers that it is not your endowment that
makes you rich-but rather hard work. From this, one can naively
infer that chance plays no part in success. My intuition is that if
millionaires are close in attributes to the average population, then
I would make the more disturbing interpretation that it is because
luck played a part. Luck is democratic and hits everyone regardless
of original skills. The author notices variations from the general
population in a few traits like tenacity and hard work: another
confusion of the necessary and the causal. That all millionaires
were persistent, hardworking people does not make persistent
hard workers become millionaires: Plenty of unsuccessful entre­
preneurs were persistent, hardworking people. In a textbook case
of naive empiricism, the author also looked for traits these mil­
lionaires had in common and figured out that they shared a taste
for risk taking. Clearly risk taking is necessary for large success­
but it is also necessary for failure. Had the author done the same
study on bankrupt citizens he would certainly have found a
predilection for risk taking.
   I was asked to "back up the claims" in the book with the "sup­
ply of data," graphs, charts, diagrams, plots, tables, numbers, rec­
ommendations, time series, etc., by some readers (and by me-too
publishers before I was lucky to find Texere).This text is a series
of logical thought experiments, not an economics term paper;
logic does not require empirical verification (again there is what I
call a "round-trip fallacy": It is a mistake to use, as journalists and
some economists do, statistics without logic, but the reverse does
not hold: It is not a mistake to use logic without statistics). If I
                            PR!;l=ACE;   xv


write that I doubt that my neighbor's success is devoid of some
measure, small or large, of luck, owing to the randomness in his
profession, I do not need to "test " it-the Russian roulette thought
experiment suffices. All I need is to show that there exists an al­
ternative explanation to the theory that he is a genius. My ap­
proach is to manufacture a cohort of intellectually challenged
persons and show how a small minority can evolve into successful
businessmen-but these are the ones who will be visible. I am not
saying that Warren Buffett is not skilled; only that a large popula­
tion of random investors will almost necessarily produce someone
with his track records just by luck.

                          Missing a Hoax
I was also surprised at the fact that in spite of the book's aggressive
warning against media journalism I was invited to television and
radio shows in both North America and Europe (including a
hilarious dialogue de sourds on a Las Vegas radio station where the
interviewer and I were running two parallel conversations) . No­
body protected me from myself and I accepted the interviews.
Strangely, one needs to use the press to communicate the message
that the press is toxic. I felt like a fraud coming up with vapid
sound bites, but had fun at it.
   It may be that I was invited because the mainstream media in­
terviewers did not read my book or understand the insults (they
don't "have the time " to read books) and the nonprofit ones read it
too well and felt vindicated by it. I have a few anecdotes: A famous
television show was told that "this guy Taleb believes that stock
analysts are just random forecasters " so they seemed eager to have
me present my ideas on the program. However, their condition
was that I make three stock recommendations to prove my "ex­
pertise." I didn't attend and missed the opportunity for a great
hoax by discussing three stocks selected randomly and fitting a
well-sounding explanation to my selection.
                            xv i   PRE�ACE



   On another television show I mentioned that "people think
that there is a story when there is none " as I was discussing the ran­
dom character of the stock market and the backfit logic one always
sees in events after the fact.The anchor immediately interjected:
"There was a story about Cisco this morning. Can you comment
on that? " The best: When invited to an hour-long discussion on a
financial radio show (they had not read Chapter 11), I was told a
few minutes before to refrain from discussing the ideas in this
book because I was invited to talk about trading and not about
randomness (another hoax opportunity certainly, but I was too
unprepared for it and walked out before the show started).
    Most journalists do not take things too seriously: After all, this
business of journalism is about pure entertainment, not a search
for truth, particularly when it comes to radio and television. The
trick is to stay away from those who do not seem to know that
they are just entertainers (like George Will, who will appear in
Chapter 2) and actually believe that they are thinkers.
    Another problem was in the interpretation of the message in
the media: This guy Nassim thinks that markets are random, hence
they are going lower, which made me the unwilling bearer of cata­
strophic messages. Black swans, those rare and unexpected devia­
tions, can be both good and bad events.
    However, media journalism is less standardized than it appears;
it attracts a significant segment of thoughtful people who manage
to extricate themselves from the commercial sound bite-driven
system and truly care about the message rather than just catching
the public's attention. One naive observation from my conversa­
tions with Kojo Anandi (NPR), Robin Lustig (BBC), Robert Scully
 (PBS), and Brian Lehrer (WNY C) is that the nonprofit journalist
is altogether another intellectual breed. Casually, the quality of
the discussion correlates inversely with the luxury of the studios:
WNY C, where I felt that Brian Lehrer was making the greatest ef­
fort at getting into the arguments, operates out of the shabbiest of­
fices I have seen this side of Kazakhstan.
                          PRE FACE    xvii

   One final comment on the style.I elected to keep the style of
this book as idiosyncratic as it was in the first edition.Homo sum,
good and bad. I am fallible and see no reason to hide my minor
flaws if they are part of my personality no more than I feel the
need to wear a wig when I have my picture taken or borrow some­
one else's nose when I show my face.Almost all the book editors
who read the draft recommended changes at the sentence level (to
make my style "better") and in the structure of the text (in the or­
ganization of chapters); I ignored almost all of them and found out
that none of the readers thought them necessary-as a matter of
fact, I find that injecting the personality of the author (imperfec­
tions included) enlivens the text. Does the book industry suffer
from the classical "expert problem" with the buildup of rules of
thumb that do not have empirical validity? More than a hundred
thousand readers later I am discovering that books are not written
for book editors.


                         Out of the Library
       he book helped me break out of my intellectual isolation
       (not being a full-time academic offers plenty of benefits, such
       as independence and the avoidance of the dull parts of the
process, but it comes at the cost of seclusion) . I made many interest­
ing dinner companions and pen pals among lucid thinkers through
the first edition, and, thanks to them, I was able to make a second
pass on some of the topics. In addition, I have gotten closer to my
dream life thanks to the stimulation of discussion with people who
share my interests; I feel that I need to pay the book back for that.
There seems to be some evidence that conversations and corre­
spondence with intelligent people is a better engine for personal ed­
ification than plain library-ratting (human warmth: Something in
our nature may help us grow ideas while dealing and socializing
with other people).Somehow there was the pre- and post-Fooled life.
While the acknowledgments for the first edition hold more than
ever, I would like to add here my newly incurred debt.

                        Shrinking the World
I first met Robert Shiller in person as we were seated next to each
other at a breakfast panel discussion. I found myself inadvertently
eating all the fruits on his plate and drinking his coffee and water,
leaving him with the muffins and other unfashionable food (and
nothing to drink). He did not complain (he may have not no­
ticed). I did not know Shiller when I featured him in the first edi­
tion and was surprised by his accessibility, his humility, and his
charm (by some heuristic one does not expect people who have
vision to be also personable). He later drove me to a bookstore in
New Haven, showed me Flatland, a scientific parable dealing with
physics that he read when he was in high school, and told me to
keep this book as it was in the first edition: short, personal, as close
to a novel as possible, something I kept in mind throughout the
exercise of this reworking (he tried to convince me to not do this
second edition, I begged him to do a second one of his own Irra­
tional Exuberance, be it only for my own consumption; I think that
I won both points). Books have bubble dynamics of the type dis­
cussed in Chapter 10, a matter that makes an extra edition of an
existing book far more likely to break through the critical point
than a new one (network externalities make religions and fads fare
incrementally better in their second editions than brand-new
ones). The physicist and crash theorist Didier Sornette provided
me with convincing arguments for the effectiveness of a second
version; we are surprised that book publishers who thrive on in­
formational cascades are not conscious of the point.
    During much of the rewriting of this book I was under the en­
ergizing influence of two intense dinner conversations in Italy
with Daniel Kahneman, which had the effect of "pushing " me to
the next critical point of intellectual drive, after I saw that his
work went so much deeper than mere rational choice under un­
certainty. I am certain that his influence on economics (including
the Nobel medal) focused people away from the breadth and
depth and the general applicability of his discoveries.Economics is
boring stuff, but His work matters I kept telling myself, not just be­
cause he is an empiricist, not just because of the contrast of the
relevance of his work (and personality) with those of the other re-
cent Nobel economists, but because of its far-reaching implica­
tions on far worthier questions: (a) He and Amos Tversky helped
stand on its head the notion of man that we owe to the dogmatic
rationalism of the Hellenistic age and which held for twenty-three
centuries, with all the damaging consequences that we know of
now; (b) Kahneman's important work is on utility theory (in its
different stages) with consequences on such significant things as
happiness.Now understanding happiness is a real pursuit.
  I had lengthy discussions with Terry Burnham, the biologist and
evolutionary economist and co-author of Mean Genes, that unpre­
tentious introduction to evolutionary psychology, who coinciden­
tally turned out to be best friends with Jamil Baz, the childhood
friend who was my sounding board with my early introspections
on randomness two decades ago.Peter McBumey got me involved
with the Artificial Intelligence community, which seems to fuse
together the fields of philosophy, cognitive neuroscience, mathe­
matics, economics, and logic.He and I started a voluminous corre­
spondence on the various theories of rationality. Michael Schrage,
one of my reviewers, is the epitome of the modern (hence scien­
tific) intellectual-he has a knack of reading everything that seems
to matter. He offers the conversation of a true intellectual,
shielded from the straitjacket of academic pressures.Ramaswami
Ambarish and Lester Siegel showed me (with their suspiciously
unnoticed work) that if we are fooled by randomness with respect
to plain performance, then performance differential is even harder
to pin down. The writer Malcolm Gladwell sent me into some in­
teresting parts of the literature on intuition and self-knowledge.
Art De Vany, the insightful and brilliantly colorful economist who
specializes in nonlinearities and rare events, started his introduc­
tory letter to me with the shibboleth "I despise textbooks." It is en­
couraging to see someone with such depth in his thinking who can
also have fun in life. The economist William Easterly showed me
that randomness contributed to illusionary causes in economic de-

velopment. He liked the link between being a skeptical empiricist
and disliking monopolies on knowledge by institutions like gov­
ernments and universities. I am grateful to Hollywood agent Jeff
Berg, an enthusiastic reader, for his insights on the wild type of un­
certainty that prevails in the media business. I have to thank the
book for allowing me to have insightful dinner discussions with
Jack Schwager, who seems to have thought of some of the prob­
lems longer than anybody alive.

                          Thank You, Google
The following people have provided me with help on this text. I
was very fortunate to have Andreea Munteanu as an incisive
reader and valuable sounding board; she spent hours away from
her impressive derivatives job checking the integrity of the refer­
ences on Google. Amanda Gharghour also helped with the
search. I was also lucky to have Gianluca Monaco as the Italian
translator; he found mistakes in the text that it would have taken
me a century to detect (a cognitive scientist and book-translator­
turned-student-of-mathematical-finance, he called up the pub­
lisher and appointed himself the translator) .My collaborator, the
philosopher of science Avital Pilpel, provided me with invaluable
help with technical probability discussions. Elie Ayache, another
Levantine-trader-mathematician-physicist-turned-philosopher­
of-science-probability-markets (though without the neurobiol­
ogy) , made me spend numerous hours at Borders Books in both
the philosophy section and the science section. Flavia Cymbal­
ista, Sole Marittimi (now Riley) , Paul Wilmott, Mark Spitznagel,
Gur Huberman, Tony Glickman, Winn Martin, Alexander Reisz,
Ted Zink, Andrei Pokrovsky, Shep Davis, Guy Riviere, Eric
Schoenberg, and Marco Di Martino provided comments on the
text. George Martin was, as usual, an invaluable sounding board.
The readers Carine Chichereau, Bruce Bellner, and Illias Kat­
sounis, gracefully e-mailed me extensive errata. I thank Cindy,

Sarah, and Alexander fo r support and the reminder that there
are other things than probability and uncertainty.
  I also have to thank my second home, the Courant Institute of
Mathematical Sciences, for providing me with the right atmo­
sphere to pursue my interests and teach and coach students while
retaining my intellectual independence, particularly Jim Gatheral,
who took the habit of heckling me while co-teaching the class. I
am indebted to Paloma's Donald Sussman and Tom Witz for their
unusual insights; I am truly impressed by their heroic ability to un­
derstand the "black swan." I also thank the Empirica members (we
ban the use of the word employees) for fostering a climate of fierce
and ruthless, truly cut-throat intellectual debate in the office.My
coworkers make sure that not a single comment on my part can go
without some sort of challenge.
  I insist once again that without David Wilson and Myles
Thompson this book would have never been initially published.
But without Will Murphy, Daniel Menaker, and Ed Klagsbrun,
who revived this book, it would have been dead. I thank Janet
Wygal for her thoroughness (and patience) and Fleetwood Rob­
bins for his assistance. Given their zeal, I doubt that many mis­
takes are left; however, those that remain are mine.

      This book is about luck disguised and perceived as nonluck
      (that is, skills) and, more generally, randomness disguised
      and perceived as non-randomness (that is, determinism) .It
manifests itself in the shape of the lucky fool, defined as a person
who benefited from a disproportionate share of luck but attrib­
utes his success to some other, generally very precise, reason.
Such confusion crops up in the most unexpected areas, even sci­
ence, though not in such an accentuated and obvious manner as it
does in the world of business.It is endemic in politics, as it can be
encountered in the shape of a country's president discoursing on
                          xi   PR O L O G U E


the jobs that "he " created, "his " recovery, and "his predecessor's "
inflation.
    We are still very close to our ancestors who roamed the savan­
nah. The formation of our beliefs is fraught with superstitions­
even today (I might say, especially today) .Just as one day some
primitive tribesman scratched his nose, saw rain falling, and devel­
oped an elaborate method of scratching his nose to bring on the
much-needed rain, we link economic prosperity to some rate cut
by the Federal Reserve Board, or the success of a company with
the appointment of the new president "at the helm." Bookstores
are full of biographies of successful men and women presenting
their specific explanation on how they made it big in life (we have
an expression, "the right time and the right place, " to weaken
whatever conclusion can be inferred from them) .This confusion
strikes people of different persuasions; the literature professor in­
vests a deep meaning into a mere coincidental occurrence of word
patterns, while the economist proudly detects "regularities " and
"anomalies " in data that are plain random.
   At the cost of appearing biased, I have to say that the literary
mind can be intentionally prone to the confusion between noise
and meaning, that is, between a randomly constructed arrange­
ment and a precisely intended message.However, this causes little
harm; few claim that art is a tool of investigation of the Truth­
rather than an attempt to escape it or make it more palatable.
Symbolism is the child of our inability and unwillingness to accept
randomness; we give meaning to all manner of shapes; we detect
human figures in inkblots.I saw mosques in the clouds announced
Arthur Rimbaud, the nineteenth-century French symbolic poet.
This interpretation took him to "poetic " Abyssinia (in East Africa) ,
where he was brutalized by a Christian Lebanese slave dealer, con­
tracted syphilis, and lost a leg to gangrene.He gave up poetry in
disgust at the age of nineteen, and died anonymously in a Mar­
seilles hospital ward while still in his thirties.But it was too late.
                          PR O L O G U E   xii


European intellectual life developed what seems t o be an irre­
versible taste for symbolism-we are still paying its price, with
psychoanalysis and other fads.
   Regrettably, some people play the game too seriously; they are
paid to read too much into things.All my life I have suffered the
conflict between my love of literature and poetry and my pro­
found allergy to most teachers of literature and "critics." The
French thinker and poet Paul Valery was surprised to listen to a
commentary of his poems that found meanings that had until then
escaped him (of course, it was pointed out to him that these were
intended by his subconscious) .
   More generally, we underestimate the share of randomness in
about everything, a point that may not merit a book-except
when it is the specialist who is the fool of all fools. Disturbingly,
science has only recently been able to handle randomness (the
growth in available information has been exceeded only by the ex­
pansion of noise) . Probability theory is a young arrival in mathe­
matics; probability applied to practice is almost nonexistent as a
discipline. In addition we seem to have evidence that what is
called "courage " comes from an underestimation of the share of
randomness in things rather than the more noble ability to stick
one's neck out for a given belief In my experience ( and in the sci­
entific literature) , economic "risk takers " are rather the victims of
delusions (leading to overoptimism and overconfidence with their
underestimation of possible adverse outcomes) than the opposite.
Their "risk taking " is frequently randomness foolishness.
   Consider the left and the right columns of Table P.l (page xliii).
The best way to summarize the major thesis of this book is that it
addresses situations (many of them tragicomical) where the left
column is mistaken for the right one. The subsections also illus­
trate the key areas of discussion on which this book will be based.
   The reader may wonder whether the opposite case might not
deserve some attention, that is, the situations where nonrandom-
                           xiii   PROLOGUE


ness is mistaken for randomness. Shouldn't we be concerned with
situations where patterns and messages may have been ignored? I
have two answers. First, I am not overly worried about the exis­
tence of undetected patterns.We have been reading lengthy and
complex messages in just about any manifestation of nature that
presents jaggedness (such as the palm of a hand, the residues at
the bottom of Turkish coffee cups, etc.) .Armed with home super­
computers and chained processors, and helped by complexity and
"chaos " theories, the scientists, semiscientists, and pseudoscientists
will be able to find portents.Second, we need to take into account
the costs of mistakes; in my opinion, mistaking the right column
for the left one is not as costly as an error in the opposite direction.
Even popular opinion warns that bad information is worse than no
information at all.
    However interesting these areas could be, their discussion would
be a tall order. There is one world in which I believe the habit of
mistaking luck for skill is most prevalent-and most conspicuous­
and that is the world of markets. By luck or misfortune, that is the
world in which I have operated most of my adult life. It is what I
know best. In addition, economic life presents the best (and most
entertaining) laboratory for the understanding of these differences.
For it is the area of human undertaking where the confusion is
greatest and its effects the most pernicious. For instance, we often
have the mistaken impression that a strategy is an excellent strategy,
or an entrepreneur a person endowed with "vision, " or a trader a tal­
ented trader, only to realize that 99.9% of their past performance is
attributable to chance, and chance alone.Ask a profitable investor to
explain the reasons for his success; he will offer some deep and con­
vincing interpretation of the results. Frequently, these delusions are
intentional and deserve to bear the name "charlatanism."
    If there is one cause for this confusion between the left and the
right sides of our table, it is our inability to think critically-we
may enjoy presenting conjectures as truth. It is our nature. Our
 mind is not equipped with the adequate machinery to handle

probabilities; such infirmity even strikes the expert, sometimes
just the expert.
   The nineteenth-century cartoon character, pot-bellied bour­
geois Monsieur Prudhomme, carried around a large sword with a
double intent: primarily to defend the Republic against its ene­
mies, and secondarily to attack it should it stray from its course. In
the same manner, this book has two purposes: to defend science
( as a light beam across the noise of randomness), and to attack the
scientist when he strays from his course (most disasters come from
the fact that individual scientists do not have an innate under­
standing of standard error or a clue about critical thinking, and
likewise have proved both incapable of dealing with probabilities
in the social sciences and incapable of accepting such fact) . As a
practitioner of uncertainty I have seen more than my share of
snake-oil salesmen dressed in the garb of scientists, particularly
those operating in economics. The greatest fools of randomness
will be found among these.
    We are flawed beyond repair, at least for this environment-but
it is only bad news for those utopians who believe in an idealized
humankind. Current thinking presents the two following polar­
ized visions of man, with little shades in between . On the one
hand there is your local college English professor; your great-aunt
Irma, who never married and liberally delivers sermons; your how­
to-reach-happiness-in-twenty-steps and how-to-become-a-better­
person-in-a-week book writer. It is called the Utopian Vision,
associated with Rousseau, Godwin, Condorcet, Thomas Paine, and
conventional normative economists (of the kind to ask you to
make rational choices because that is what is deemed good for
you), etc. They believe in reason and rationality-that we should
overcome cultural impediments on our way to becoming a better
human race-thinking we can control our nature at will and trans­
form it by mere edict in order to attain, among other things, hap­
piness and rationality. Basically this category would include those
                          PR O L O G U E   xiv


who think that the cure for obesity i s t o inform people that they
should be healthy.
   On the other hand there is the Tragic Vision of humankind that
believes in the existence of inherent limitations and flaws in the
way we think and act and requires an acknowledgment of this fact
as a basis for any individual and collective action.This category of
people includes Karl Popper (falsificationism and distrust of intel­
lectual "answers, " actually of anyone who is confident that he
knows anything with certainty) , Friedrich Hayek and Milton
Friedman (suspicion of governments) , Adam Smith (intention of
man) , Herbert Simon (bounded rationality) , Amos Tversky and
Daniel Kahneman (heuristics and biases) , the speculator George
Soros, etc. The most neglected one is the misundersto'od philoso­
pher Charles Sanders Peirce, who was born a hundred years too
early (he coined the term scientific "fallibilism " in opposition to
Papal infallibility). Needless to say that the ideas of this book fall
squarely into the Tragic category: We are faulty and there is no
need to bother trying to correct our flaws.We are so defective and
so mismatched to our environment that we can just work around
these flaws. I am convinced of that after spending almost all my
adult and professional years in a fierce fight between my brain (not
Fooled by Randomness) and my emotions (completely Fooled by
Randomness) in which the only success I've had is in going around
my emotions rather than rationalizing them. Perhaps ridding our­
selves of our humanity is not in the works; we need wily tricks, not
some grandiose moralizing help.As an empiricist (actually a skep­
tical empiricist) I despise the moralizers beyond anything on this
planet: I still wonder why they blindly believe in ineffectual meth­
ods.Delivering advice assumes that our cognitive apparatus rather
than our emotional machinery exerts some meaningful control
over our actions. We will see how modern behavioral science
shows this to be completely untrue.
   My colleague Bob Jaeger (he followed the opposite course of
                          xlvi   P R O L O G U E;


mine of moving from philosophy professor to trader) presents a
more potent view of the dichotomy: There are those who think
that there are easy clear-cut answers and those who don't think
that simplification is possible without severe distortion (his hero:
Wittgenstein; his villain: Descartes) . I am enamored of the differ­
ence as I think that the generator of the Fooled by Randomness
problem, the false belief in determinism, is also associated with
such reduction of the dimensionality of things.As much as you be­
lieve in the "keep-it-simple-stupid" it is the simplification that is
dangerous.
   This author hates books that can be easily guessed from the
table of contents (not many people read textbooks for pleasure)­
but a hint of what comes next seems in order. The book is com­
posed of three parts. The first is an introspection into Solon's
warning, as his outburst on rare events became my lifelong motto.
In it we meditate on visible and invisible histories and the elusive
property of rare events (black swans) .The second presents a col­
lection of probability biases I encountered (and suffered from) in
my career in randomness-ones that continue to fool me. The
third illustrates my personal jousting with my biology and con­
cludes the book with a presentation of a few practical (wax in my
ears) and philosophical (stoicism) aids. Before the "enlighten­
ment" and the age of rationality, there was in the culture a collec­
tion of tricks to deal with our fallibility and reversals of fortunes.
The elders can still help us with some of their ruses.

        roesus, King of Lydia, was considered the richest man of
        his time. To this day Romance languages use the expres­
        sion "rich as Croesus " to describe a person of excessive
wealth. He was said to be visited by Solon, the Greek legislator
known for his dignity, reserve, upright morals, humility, frugality,
wisdom, intelligence, and courage. Solon did not display the small­
est surprise at the wealth and splendor surrounding his host, nor
the tiniest admiration for their owner.Croesus was so irked by the
manifest lack of impression on the part of this illustrious visitor
that he attempted to extract from him some acknowledgment.He
asked him if he had known a happier man than him. Solon cited
the life of a man who led a noble existence and died while in bat­
tle.Prodded for more, he gave similar examples of heroic but ter­
minated lives, until Croesus, irate, asked him point-blank if he was
not to be considered the happiest man of all. Solon answered:
"The observation of the numerous misfortunes that attend all con­
ditions forbids us to grow insolent upon our present enjoyments,
or to admire a man's happiness that may yet, in course of time,
suffer change. For the uncertain future has yet to come, with all
variety of future; and him only to whom the divinity has [guaran­
teed] continued happiness until the end we may call happy. "

      The modern equivalent has been no less eloquently voiced
   by the baseball coach Yogi Berra, who seems to have translated
   Solon's outburst from the pure Attic Greek into no less pure
   Brooklyn English with "it ain't over until it's over, " or, in a less dig­
   nified manner, with "it ain't over until the fat lady sings." In addi­
   tion, aside from his use of the vernacular, the Yogi Berra quote
   presents an advantage of being true, while the meeting between
   Croesus and Solon was one of those historical facts that benefited
   from the imagination of the chroniclers, as it was chronologically
   impossible for the two men to have been in the same location.
      Part I is concerned with the degree to which a situation may
   yet, in the course of time, suffer change. For we can be tricked by
   situations involving mostly the activities of the goddess Fortuna­
   Jupiter's firstborn daughter. Solon was wise enough to get the fol­
   lowing point; that which came with the help of luck could be
   taken away by luck (and often rapidly and unexpectedly at that) .
   The flipside, which deserves to be considered as well (in fact it is
,. even more of our concern), is that things that come with little
   help from luck are more resistant to randomness. Solon also had
   the intuition of a problem that has obsessed science for the past
   three centuries. It is called the problem of induction. I call it in this
   book the black swan or the rare event. Solon even understood an­
   other linked problem, which I call the skewness issue; it does not
   matter how frequently something succeeds if failure is too costly
   to bear.
      Yet the story of Croesus has another twist. Having lost a battle
   to the redoubtable Persian king Cyrus, he was about to be burned
   alive when he called Solon's name and shouted (something like)
   "Solon, you were right " (again this is legend) .Cyrus asked about
   the nature of such unusual invocations, and he told him about
   Solon's warning. This impressed Cyrus so much that he decided to
   spare Croesus' life, as he reflected on the possibilities as far as his
   own fate was concerned. People were thoughtful at that time.

                          NERO TULI P

                          Hit by Lightning
       ero Tulip became obsessed with trading after witnessing a
       strange scene one spring day as he was visiting the Chicago
         Mercantile Exchange.A red convertible Porsche, driven at
several times the city speed limit, abruptly stopped in front of the
entrance, its tires emitting the sound of pigs being slaughtered.A
visibly demented athletic man in his thirties, his face flushed red,
emerged and ran up the steps as if he were chased by a tiger. He
left the car double-parked, its engine running, provoking an angry
fanfare of horns.After a long minute, a bored young man clad in a
yellow jacket (yellow was the color reserved for clerks) came
                      6    S O L O N ' S WAR N I N G


down the steps, visibly untroubled by the traffic commotion. He
drove the car into the underground parking garage-perfunctorily,
as if it were his daily chore.
   That day Nero Tulip was hit with what the French call a coup de
Joudre, a sudden intense (and obsessive) infatuation that strikes
like lightning. "This is for me]" he screamed enthusiastically-he
could not help comparing the life of a trader to the alternative
lives that could present themselves to him.Academia conjured up
the image of a silent university office with rude secretaries; busi­
ness, the image of a quiet office staffed with slow thinkers and
semislow thinkers who express themselves in full sentences.

                          Temporary Sanity
Unlike a coup de Joudre, the infatuation triggered by the Chicago
scene has not left him more than a decade and a half after the in­
cident. For Nero swears that no other lawful profession in our
times could be as devoid of boredom as that of the trader. Fur­
thermore, although he has not yet practiced the profession of
high-sea piracy, he is now convinced that even that occupation
would present more dull moments than that of the trader.
   Nero could best be described as someone who randomly (and
abruptly) swings between the deportment and speech manners of
a church historian and the verbally abusive intensity of a Chicago
pit trader. He can commit hundreds of millions of dollars in a
transaction without a blink or a shadow of a second thought, yet
agonize between two appetizers on the menu, changing his mind
back and forth and wearing out the most patient of waiters.
   Nero holds an undergraduate degree in ancient literature and
mathematics from Cambridge University. He enrolled in a Ph.D.
program in statistics at the University of Chicago but, after com­
pleting the prerequisite coursework, as well as the bulk of his doc­
toral research, he switched to the philosophy department. He
called the switch "a moment of temporary sanity/' adding to the
     I F Y O U ' RE S O R I C I-I , W I-I V AREN ' T Y O U S O S M ART ?   7


consternation of his thesis director, who warned him against
philosophers and predicted his return back to the fold.He finished
writing his thesis in philosophy. But not the Derrida continental
style of incomprehensible philosophy (that is, incomprehensible to
anyone outside of their ranks, like myself) . It was quite the oppo­
site; his thesis was on the methodology of statistical inference in its
application to the social sciences. In fact, his thesis was indistin­
guishable from a thesis in mathematical statistics-it was just a bit
more thoughtful (and twice as long) .
   It is often said that philosophy cannot feed its man-but that
was not the reason Nero left. He left because philosophy cannot
entertain its man. At first, it started looking futile; he recalled his
statistics thesis director's warnings. Then, suddenly, it started to
look like work.As he became tired of writing papers on some ar­
cane details of his earlier papers, he gave up the academy. The ac­
ademic debates bored him to tears, particularly when minute
points (invisible to the noninitiated) were at stake.Action was
what Nero required.The problem, however, was that he selected
the academy in the first place in order to kill what he detected was
the flatness and tempered submission of employment life.
   After witnessing the scene of the trader chased by a tiger, Nero
found a trainee spot on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the
large exchange where traders transact by shouting and gesticulat­
ing frenetically.There he worked for a prestigious (but eccentric)
local, who trained him in the Chicago style, in return for Nero
solving his mathematical equations.The energy in the air proved
motivating to Nero. He rapidly graduated to the rank of self­
employed trader.Then, when he got tired of standing on his feet
in the crowd, and straining his vocal cords, he decided to seek em­
ployment "upstairs, " that is, trading from a desk.He moved to the
New York area and took a position with an investment house.
    Nero specialized in quantitative financial products, in which he
had an early moment of glory, became famous and in demand.

Many investment houses in New York and London flashed huge
guaranteed bonuses at him.Nero spent a couple of years shuttling
between the two cities, attending important "meetings" and wear­
ing expensive suits. But soon Nero went into hiding; he rapidly
pulled back to anonymity-the Wall Street stardom track did not
quite fit his temperament.To stay a "hot trader " requires some or­
ganizational ambitions and a power hunger that he feels lucky not
to possess. He was only in it for the fun-and his idea of fun does
not include a dministrative and managerial work. He is susceptible
to conference room boredom and is incapable of talking to busi­
nessmen, particularly the run-of-the-mill variety. Nero is allergic
to the vocabulary of business talk, not just on plain aesthetic
grounds. Phrases like "game plan, " "bottom line, " "how to get there
from here, " "we provide our clients with solutions, " "our mission, "
and other hackneyed expressions that dominate meetings lack
both the precision and the coloration that he prefers to hear.
Whether people populate silence with hollow sentences, or if such
meetings present any true merit, he does not know; at any rate he
did not want to be part of it. Indeed Nero's extensive social life in­
cludes almost no businesspeople. But unlike me (I can be ex­
tremely humiliating when someone rubs me the wrong way with
inelegant pompousness) , Nero handles himself with gentle aloof­
ness in these circumstances.
   So, Nero switched careers to what is called proprietary trading .
Traders are set up as independent entities, internal funds with
their own allocation of capital. They are left alone to do as they
please, provided of course that their results satisfy the executives.
The name proprietary comes from the fact that they trade the
company's own capital. At the end of the year they receive be­
tween 7% and 12 % of the profits generated.The proprietary trader
has all the benefits of self-employment, and none of the burdens
of running the mundane details of his own business. He can work
any hours he likes, travel at a whim, and engage in all manner of
     I I= Y O U ' R E S O R I C I-I , W I-I V A R E N ' T Y O U S O S M A R T ?   9


personal pursuits. It is paradise for an intellectual like Nero who
dislikes manual work and values unscheduled meditation. He has
been doing that for the past ten years, in the employment of two
different trading firms.

                               Modus Operandi
A word on Nero's methods. He is as conservative a trader as one
can be in such a business. In the past he has had good years and
less than good years-but virtually no truly "bad" years.Over these
years he has slowly built for himself a stable nest egg, thanks to an
income ranging between $300, 000 and (at the peak) $2.5 million.
On average, he manages to accumulate $ 5 00,000 a year in after­
tax money (from an average income of about $ 1 million); this goes
straight into his savings account. In 1 99 3 , he had a bad year and
was made to feel uncomfortable in his company. Other traders
made out much better, so the capital at his disposal was severely
reduced, and he was made to feel undesirable at the institution.
He then went to get an identical job, down to an identically de­
signed workspace, but in a different firm that was friendlier. In the
fall of 1 994 the traders who had been competing for the great per­
formance award blew up in unison during the worldwide bond
market crash that resulted from the random tightening by the Fed­
eral Reserve Bank of the United States.They are all currently out
of the market, performing a variety of tasks.This business has a
high mortality rate.
  Why isn't Nero more affluent? Because of his trading style-or
perhaps his personality. His risk aversion is extreme.Nero's objec­
tive is not to maximize his profits, so much as it is to avoid having
this entertaining machine called trading taken away from him.
Blowing up would mean returning to the tedium of the university
or the nontrading life.Every time his risks increase, he conjures up
the image of the quiet hallway at the university, the long mornings
at his desk spent in revising a paper, kept awake by bad coffee.No,
                      10   S O L O N ' S WAR N I N G


he does not want to have to face the solemn university library
where he was bored to tears."I am shooting for longevity," he is
wont to say.
    Nero has seen many traders blow up, and does not want to get
into that situation. Blow up in the lingo has a precise meaning; it
does not just mean to lose money; it means to lose more money
than one ever expected, to the point of being thrown out of the
business (the equivalent of a doctor losing his license to practice or
a lawyer being disbarred) .Nero rapidly exits trades after a prede­
termined loss. He never sells "naked options" (a strategy that
would leave him exposed to large possible losses) .He never puts
himself in a situation where he can lose more than, say, $1 mil­
lion-regardless of the probability of such an event. That amount
has always been variable; it depends on his accumulated profits for
the year.This risk aversion prevented him from making as much
money as the other traders on Wall Street who are often called
"Masters of the Universe." The firms he has worked for generally
allocate more money to traders with a different style from Nero,
like John, whom we will encounter soon.
    Nero's temperament is such that he does not mind losing small
change."I love taking small losses," he says."I just need my winners
to be large." In no circumstances does he want to be exposed to
those rare events, like panics and sudden crashes, that wipe a trader
out in a flash. To the contrary, he wants to benefit from them.
When people ask him why he does not hold on to losers, he in­
variably answers that he was trained by "the most chicken of them
all," the Chicago trader Stevo who taught him the business.This is
not true; the real reason is his training in probability and his innate
skepticism.
    There is another reason why Nero is not as rich as others in his
situation. His skepticism does not allow him to invest any of his
own funds outside of treasury bonds. He therefore missed out on
the great bull market.The reason he offers is that it could have
turned out to be a bear market and a trap.Nero harbors a deep
     1 1= Y O U ' R E S O R I C H ; W H Y AR E N ' T Y O U S O S M ART ?   11


suspicion that the stock market i s some form o f a n investment
scam and cannot bring himself to own a stock.T he difference with
people around him who were enriched by the stock market was
that he was cash-flow rich, but his assets did not inflate at all along
with the rest of the world (his treasury bonds hardly changed in
value) . He contrasts himself with one of those start-up technology
companies that were massively cash-flow negative, but for which
the hordes developed some infatuation. T his allowed the owners
to become rich from their stock valuation, and thus dependent on
the randomness of the market's election of the winner.T he differ­
ence with his friends of the investing variety is that he did not de­
pend on the bull market, and, accordingly, does not have to worry
about a bear market at all. His net worth is not a function of the
investment of his savings-he does not want to depend on his in­
vestments, but on his cash earnings, for his enrichment. He takes
not an inch of risk with his savings, which he invests in the safest
possible vehicles. Treasury bonds are safe; they are issued by the
United States government, and governments can hardly go bank­
rupt since they can freely print their own currency to pay back
their obligation.

                              No Work Ethics
Today, at thirty-nine, after fourteen years in the business, he can
consider himself comfortably settled.His personal portfolio con­
tains several million dollars in medium-maturity Treasury bonds,
enough to eliminate any worry about the future. What he likes
most about proprietary trading is that it requires considerably less
time than other high-paying professions; in other words it is per­
fectly compatible with his non-middle-class work ethic. Trading
forces someone to think hard; those who merely work hard gener­
ally lose their focus and intellectual energy. In addition, they end
up drowning in randomness; work ethics, Nero believes, draw peo­
ple to focus on noise rather than the signal (the difference we es­
tablished in Table P. l on page xliii) .
                         12   S O L O N ' S WA R N I N G


    This free time has allowed him to carry on a variety of personal
interests.As Nero reads voraciously and spends considerable time
in the gym and museums, he cannot have a lawyer's or a doctor's
schedule. Nero found the time to go back to the statistics de­
partment where he started his doctoral studies and finished the
"harder science " doctorate in statistics, by rewriting his thesis
in more concise terms. Nero now teaches, once a year, a half­
semester seminar called History of Probabilistic Thinking in the
mathematics department of New York University, a class of great
originality that draws excellent graduate students. He has saved
enough to be able to maintain his lifestyle in the future and has
contingency plans perhaps to retire into writing popular essays of
the scientific-literary variety, with themes revolving around proba­
bility and indeterminism-but only if some event in the future
causes the markets to shut down. Nero believes that risk-conscious
hard work and discipline can lead someone to achieve a comfort­
able life with a very high probability. Beyond that, it is all ran­
domness: either by taking enormous (and unconscious) risks, or by
being extraordinarily lucky. Mild success can be explainable by
skills and labor.Wild success is attributable to variance.

                       There Are Always Secrets
Nero's probabilistic introspection may have been helped out by a
dramatic event in his life-one that he kept to himself. A pene­
trating observer might detect in Nero a measure of suspicious ex­
uberance, an unnatural drive. For his life is not as crystalline as it
may seem. Nero harbors a secret, one that will be discussed in
time.

Through most of the 1990s, across the street from Nero's house
stood John's-a much larger one.John was a high-yield trader, but
     I F Y O U ' R E: S O R I C I-I , W I-I V AR E: N ' T Y O U S O S M AR T ?   13


he was not a trader in the style of Nero.A brief professional con­
versation with him would have revealed that he presented the in­
tellectual depth and sharpness of mind of an aerobics instructor
(though not the physique) .A purblind man could have seen that
John had been doing markedly better than Nero (or, at least, felt
compelled to show it) . He parked two top-of-the-line German
cars in his driveway (his and hers) , in addition to two convertibles
(one of which was a collectible Ferrari) , while Nero had been driv­
ing the same VW Cabriolet for almost a decade-and still does.
   The wives of John and Nero were acquaintances, of the health­
club type, but Nero's wife felt extremely uncomfortable in the
company of John's.She felt that the lady was not merely trying to
impress her, but was treating her like someone inferior. While
Nero had become inured to the sight of traders getting rich (and
trying too hard to become sophisticated by turning into wine col­
lectors and opera lovers) , his wife had rarely encountered re­
pressed new wealth-the type of people who have felt the sting of
indigence at some point in their lives and want to get even by ex­
hibiting their wares.The only dark side of being a trader, Nero
often says, is the sight of money being showered on unprepared
people who are suddenly taught that Vivaldi's Four Seasons is "re­
fined" music.But it was hard for his spouse to be exposed almost
daily to the neighbor who kept boasting of the new decorator they
just hired. John and his wife were not the least uncomfortable
with the fact that their "library" came with the leather-bound
books (her health club reading was limited to People magazine but
her shelves included a selection of untouched books by dead
American authors) .She also kept discussing unpronounceable ex­
otic locations where they would repair during their vacations
without so much as knowing the smallest thing about the places­
she would have been hard put to explain on which continent the
Seychelles Islands are located. Nero's wife is all too human; al­
though she kept telling herself that she did not want to be in
                     14    S O L O N ' S WA R N I N G


the shoes of John's wife, she felt as if she had been somewhat
swamped in the competition of life.Somehow words and reason
became ineffectual in front of an oversized diamond, a monstrous
house, and a sports car collection.

                          An Overpaid Hick
Nero also suffered the same ambiguous feeling toward his neigh­
bors.He was quite contemptuous of John, who represented about
everything he is not and does not want to be-but there was the
social pressure that was starting to weigh on him.In addition, he
too would like to have sampled such excessive wealth.Intellectual
contempt does not control personal envy. That house across the
street kept getting bigger, with addition after addition-and Nero's
discomfort kept apace. While Nero had succeeded beyond his
wildest dreams, both personally and intellectually, he was starting
to consider himself as having missed a chance somewhere. In the
pecking order of Wall Street, the arrival of such types as John had
caused him to be a significant trader no longer-but while he used
to not care about this, John and his house and his cars had started
to gnaw away at him.All would have been well if Nero had not
had that stupid large house across the street judging him with a
superficial standard every morning. Was it the animal pecking
order at play, with John's house size making Nero a beta male?
Worse even, John was about five years his junior, and, despite a
shorter career, was making at least ten times his income.
   When they used to run into each other Nero had a clear feeling
that John tried to put him down-with barely detectable but no
less potent signs of condescension.Some days John ignored him
completely. Had John been a remote character, one Nero could
only read about in the papers, the situation would have been dif­
ferent.But there John was in flesh and bones and he was his neigh­
bor. The mistake Nero made was to start talking to him, as the rule
of pecking order immediately emerged.Nero tried to soothe his
    I F Y O U 'RE S O R I C I-I , W I-I V ARE N ' T Y O U S O S M ART ?   15


discomfort by recalling the behavior o f Swann, the character in
Proust's In Search of Time Lost, a refined art dealer and man of
leisure who was at ease with such men as his personal friend the
then Prince of Wales, but acted like he had to prove something in
the presence of the middle class. It was much easier for Swann to
mix with the aristocratic and well-established set of Guermantes
than it was with the social-climbing one of the Verdurins, · no
doubt because he was far more confident in their presence. Like­
wise Nero can exact some form of respect from prestigious and
prominent people. He regularly takes long meditative walks in
Paris and Venice with an erudite Nobel Prize-caliber scientist (the
kind of person who no longer has to prove anything) who actively
seeks his conversation. A very famous billionaire speculator calls
him regularly to ask him his opinion on the valuation of some de­
rivative securities. But there he was obsessively trying to gain the
respect of some overpaid hick with a cheap New Jersey "Noo­
Joyzy" accent. (Had I been in Nero's shoes I would have paraded
some of my scorn to John with the use of body language, but
again, Nero is a nice person .)
   Clearly, John was not as well educated, well bred, physically fit,
or perceived as being as intelligent as Nero-but that was not all;
he was not even as street-smart as him! Nero has met true street­
smart people in the pits of Chicago who exhibit a rapidity of
thinking that he could not detect in John. Nero was convinced
that the man was a confident shallow-thinker who had done well
because he never made an allowance for his vulnerability. But
Nero could not, at times, repress his envy-he wondered wh ether
it was an objective evaluation of John, or if it was his feelings of
being slighted that led him to such an assessment of John . Perhaps
it was Nero who was not quite the best trader. Maybe if he had
pushed himself harder or had sought the right opportunity­
instead of "thinking," writing articles and reading complicated
papers. Perhaps he should have been involved in the high-yield
                      16   S O L O N ' S WAR N I N G


business, where he would have shined among those shallow­
thinkers like John.
    So Nero tried to soothe his jealousy by investigating the rules of
pecking order. Psychologists have shown that most people prefer
to make $70, 000 when others around them are making $60, 000
than to make $80, 000 when others around them are making
$90, 000. Economics, schmeconomics, it is all pecking order, he
thought. No such analysis could prevent him from assessing his
condition in an absolute rather than a relative way. With John,
Nero felt that, for all his intellectual training, he was just another
one of those who would prefer to make less money provided oth­
ers made even less.
   Nero thought that there was at least a hint to support the idea
of John being merely lucky-in other words Nero, after all, might
not need to move away from his neighbor's starter palazzo.There
was hope that John would meet his undoing.For John seemed un­
aware of one large hidden risk he was taking, the risk of blowup, a
risk he could not see because he had too short an experience of
the market (but also because he was not thoughtful enough to
study history) .How could John, with his coarse mind, otherwise
be making so much money? This business of junk bonds depends
on some knowledge of the "odds," a calculation of the probability
of the rare (or random) events. What do such fools know about
odds? These traders use "quantitative tools" that give them the
odds-and Nero disagrees with the methods used. This high-yield
market resembles a nap on a railway track.One afternoon, the sur­
prise train would run you over. You make money every month for
a long time, then lose a multiple of your cumulative performance
in a few hours. He has seen it with option sellers in 19 87, 1989,
1992, and 1998. One day they are taken off the exchange floors,
accompanied by oversized security men, and nobody ever sees
them again.The big house is simply a loan; John might end up as
a luxury car salesman somewhere in New Jersey, selling to the new
     I F Y O U ' RE S O R I C I-I , W I-I V AREN ' T Y O U S O S M ART ?   17


newly rich who no doubt would feel comfortable in his presence.
Nero cannot blow up.His less oversized abode, with its four thou­
sand books, is his own. No market event can take it away from
him. Every one of his losses is limited. His trader's dignity will
never, never be threatened.
  John, for his part, thought of Nero as a loser, and a snobbish
overeducated loser at that. Nero was involved in a mature busi­
ness. He believed that he was way over the hill. "These 'prop'
traders are dying, " he used to say. "They think they are smarter
than everybody else, but they are passe."


                     T l-I E IH D - I-I OT SU M M ER

Finally, in September 1 998, Nero was vindicated. One morning
while leaving to go to work he saw John in his front yard unusu­
ally smoking a cigarette. He was not wearing a business suit. He
looked humble; his customary swagger was gone. Nero immedi­
ately knew that John had been fired.What he did not suspect was
that John also lost almost everything he had.We will see more de­
tails of John's losses in Chapter 5 .
    Nero felt ashamed of his feelings o f Schadenfreude, the joy hu­
mans can experience upon their rivals' misfortunes.But he could
not repress it.Aside from it being unchivalrous, it was said to bring
bad luck (Nero is weakly superstitious) . But in this case, Nero's
merriment did not come from the fact that John went back to his
place in life, so much as it was from the fact that Nero's methods,
beliefs, and track record had suddenly gained in credibility. Nero
would be able to raise public money on his track record precisely
because such a thing could not possibly happen to him.A repeti­
tion of such an event would pay off massively for him. Part of
Nero's elation also came from the fact that he felt proud of his
sticking to his strategy for so long, in spite of the pressure to be the
alpha male. It was also because he would no longer question his
                      18   S O L O N ' S WAR N I N G


trading style when others were getting rich because they misun­
derstood the structure of randomness and market cycles.

                   Serotonin and Randomness
Can we judge the success of people by their raw performance and
their personal wealth? Sometimes-but not always. We will see
how, at any point in time, a large section of businessmen with out­
standing track records will be no better than randomly thrown
darts. More curiously, and owing to a peculiar bias, cases will
abound of the least-skilled businessmen being the richest. How­
ever, they will fail to make an allowance for the role of luck in
their performance.
    Lucky fools do not bear the slightest suspicion that they may be
lucky fools-by definition, they do not know that they belong to
such a category.T hey will act as if they deserved the money.Their
strings of successes will inject them with so much serotonin (or
some similar substance) that they will even fool themselves about
their ability to outperform markets (our hormonal system does
not know whether our successes depend on randomness).One can
notice it in their posture; a profitable trader will walk upright,
dominant style-and will tend to talk more than a losing trader.
Scientists found out that serotonin, a neurotransmitter, seems to
command a large share of our human behavior. It sets a positive
feedback, the virtuous cycle, but, owing to an external kick from
randomness, can start a reverse motion and cause a vicious cycle.
It has been shown that monkeys injected with serotonin will rise
in the pecking order, which in turn causes an increase of the sero­
tonin level in their blood-until the virtuous cycle breaks and
starts a vicious one (during the vicious cycle failure will cause one
to slide in the pecking order, causing a behavior that will bring
about further drops in the pecking order) . Likewise, an increase in
personal performance (regardless of whether it is caused deter­
ministically or by the agency of Lady Fortuna) induces a rise of
     I I= Y O U ' RE S O R I C I-I , W I-I V AREN ' T Y O U S O S M ART ?   19


serotonin in the subject, itself causing an increase of what is com­
monly called "leadership " ability. One is "on a roll. " Some imper­
ceptible changes in deportment, like an ability to express oneself
with serenity and confidence, make the subject look credible-as
if he truly deserved the shekels.Randomness will be ruled out as a
possible factor in the performance, until it rears its head once
again and delivers the kick that will induce the downward spiral.
   A word on the display of emotions.Almost no one can conceal
his emotions. Behavioral scientists believe that one of the main
reasons why people become leaders is not from what skills they
seem to possess, but rather from what extremely superficial im­
pression they make on others through hardly perceptible physical
signals-what we call today "charisma, " for example.The biology
of the phenomenon is now well studied under the subject heading
"social emotions." Meanwhile some historian will "explain " the
success in terms of, perhaps, tactical skills, the right education, or
some other theoretical reason seen in hindsight. In addition, there
seems to be curious evidence of a link between leadership and a
form of psychopathology (the sociopath) that encourages the non­
blinking, self-confident, insensitive person to rally followers.
   People have often had the bad taste of asking me in a social set­
ting if my day in trading was profitable.If my father were there, he
would usually stop them by saying "never ask a man if he is from
Sparta: If he were, he would have let you know such an important
fact-and if he were not, you could hurt his feelings." Likewise,
never ask a trader if he is profitable; you can easily see it in his ges­
ture and gait. People in the profession can easily tell if traders are
making or losing money; head traders are quick at identifying an
employee who is faring poorly. Their face will seldom reveal
much, as people consciously attempt to gain control of their facial
expressions.But the way they walk, the way they hold the tele­
phone, and the hesitation in their behavior will not fail to reveal
their true disposition. On the morning after John had been fired,
                     20   S O L O N ' S WA R N I N G


he certainly lost much of his serotonin-unless it was another sub­
stance that researchers will discover in another decade. One cab
driver in Chicago explained to me that he could tell if traders he
picked up near the Chicago Board of Tra de, a futures exchange,
were doing well. "They get all puffed up," he said.I found it inter­
esting (and mysterious) that he could detect it so rapidly. I later
got some plausible explanation from evolutionary psychology,
which claims that such physical manifestations of one's perform­
ance in life, j ust like an animal's dominant condition, can be used
for signaling: It makes the winners seem easily visible, which is ef­
ficient in mate selection.

We close this chapter with a hint on the next discussion of resist­
ance to randomness.Recall that Nero can be considered prosper­
ous but not "very rich" by his day's standards. However, according
to some strange accounting measure we will see in the next chap­
ter, he is extremely rich on the average of lives he could have led­
he takes so little risk in his trading career that there could have
been very few disastrous outcomes.The fact that he did not expe­
rience John's success was the reason he did not suffer his downfall.
He would be therefore wealthy according to this unusual (and
probabilistic) method of accounting for wealth.Recall that Nero
protects himself from the rare event. Had Nero had to relive his
professional life a few million times, very few sample paths would
be marred by bad luck-but, owing to his conservatism, very few
as well would be affected by extreme good luck.That is, his life in
stability would be similar to that of an ecclesiastic clock repair­
man. Naturally, we are discussing only his professional life, ex­
cluding his (sometimes volatile) private one.
    Arguably, in expectation, a dentist is considerably richer than
the rock musician who is driven in a pink Rolls Royce, the specu-

lator who bids up the price of impressionist paintings, or the en­
trepreneur who collects private jets. For one cannot consider a
profession without taking into account the average of the people
who enter it, not the sample of those who have succeeded in it.
We will examine the point later from the vantage point of the sur­
vivorship bias, but here, in Part I, we will look at it with respect to
resistance to randomness.
   Consider two neighbors, John Doe A, a janitor who won the
New Jersey lottery and moved to a wealthy neighborhood, com­
pared to John Doe B, his next-door neighbor of more modest con­
dition who has been drilling teeth eight hours a day over the past
thirty-five years. Clearly one can say that, thanks to the dullness of
his career, if John Doe B had to relive his life a few thousand times
since graduation from dental school, the range of possible out­
comes would be rather narrow (assuming he is properly insured) .
At the best, he would end up drilling the rich teeth of the New York
Park Avenue residents, while the worst would show him drilling
those of some semideserted town full of trailers in the Catskills.
Furthermore, assuming he graduated from a very prestigious teeth­
drilling school, the range of outcomes would be even more com­
pressed.As to John Doe A, if he had to relive his life a million times,
almost all of them would see him performing janitorial activities
(and spending endless dollars on fruitless lottery tickets) , and one
in a million would see him winning the New Jersey lottery.
   The idea of taking into account both the observed and unob­
served possible outcomes sounds like lunacy. For most people,
probability is about what may happen in the future, not events in
the observed past; an event that has already taken place has 100%
probability, i.e., certainty. I have discussed the point with many
people who platitudinously accuse me of confusing myth and re­
ality. Myths, particularly well-aged ones, as we saw with Solon's
warning, can be far more potent (and provide us with more expe­
rience) than plain reality.

    On alternative histories, a probabilistic view of the world, in­

                  ALTERNATI V E I-I I S TORV

   start with the platitude that one cannot judge a performance
   in any given field (war, politics, medicine, investments) by the
   results, but by the costs of the alternative (i.e. , if history played
out in a different way) . Such substitute courses of events are
called alternative histories. Clearly, the quality of a decision can­
not be solely judged based on its outcome, but such a point
seems to be voiced only by people who fail (those who succeed
attribute their success to the quality of their decision) . Such
opinion-"that I followed the best course "-is what politicians
on their way out of office keep telling those members of the press
             A B I Z A R R E A C C O U N T I N G M E T I-I O D   23


who still listen to them-eliciting the customary commiserating
"yes, we know " that makes the sting even worse. And like many
platitudes, this one, while being too obvious, is not easy to carry
out in practice.

                            Russian Roulette
One can illustrate the strange concept of alternative histories as
follows. Imagine an eccentric (and bored) tycoon offering you $ 1 0
million to play Russian roulette, i.e., to put a revolver containing
one bullet in the six available chambers to your head and pull the
trigger. Each realization would count as one history, for a total of
six possible histories of equal probabilities. Five out of these six
histories would lead to enrichment; one would lead to a statistic,
that is, an obituary with an embarrassing (but certainly original)
cause of death.The problem is that only one of the histories is ob­
served in reality; and the winner of $ 1 0 million would elicit the ad­
miration and praise of some fatuous journalist (the very same ones
who unconditionally admire the Forbes 500 billionaires) .Like al­
most every executive I have encountered during an eighteen-year
career on Wall Street (the role of such executives in my view being
no more than a judge of results delivered in a random manner) , the
public observes the external signs of wealth without even having a
glimpse at the source (we call such source the generator) . Consider
the possibility that the Russian roulette winner would be used as a
role model by his family, friends, and neighbors.
  While the remaining five histories are not observable, the wise
and thoughtful person could easily make a guess as to their attrib­
utes.It requires some thoughtfulness and personal courage. In ad­
dition, in time, if the roulette-betting fool keeps playing the game,
the bad histories will tend to catch up with him. Thus, if a twenty­
five-year-old played Russian roulette, say, once a year, there would
be a very slim possibility of his surviving until his fiftieth birth­
day-but, if there are enough players, say thousands of twenty-
                      24   S O L O N ' S WA R N I N G


five-year-old players, we can expect to see a handful of (extremely
rich) survivors (and a very large cemetery) . Here I have to admit
that the example of Russian roulette is more than intellectual to
me.I lost a comrade to this "game " during the Lebanese war, when
we were in our teens. But there is more. I discovered that I had
more than a shallow interest in literature thanks to the effect of
Graham Greene's account of his flirt with such a game; it bore a
stronger effect on me than the actual events I had recently wit­
nessed. Greene claimed that he once tried to soothe the dullness
of his childhood by pulling the trigger on a revolver-making me
shiver at the thought that I had at least a one in six probability of
having been without his novels.
    The reader can see my unusual notion of alternative account­
ing: $10 million earned through Russian roulette does not have
the same value as $ 10 million earned through the diligent and art­
ful practice of dentistry. They are the same, can buy the same
goods, except that one's dependence on randomness is greater
than the other.To an accountant, though, they would be identical;
to your next-door neighbor too. Yet, deep down, I cannot help but
consider them as qualitatively different.The notion of such alter­
native accounting has interesting intellectual extensions and lends
itself to mathematical formulation, as we will see in the next
chapter with our introduction of the Monte Carlo engine. Note
that such use of mathematics is only illustrative, aiming at getting
the intuition of the point, and should not be interpreted as an en­
gineering issue.In other words, one need not actually compute the
alternative histories so much as assess their attributes. Mathemat­
ics is not just a "numbers game, " it is a way of thinking.We will see
that probability is a qualitative subject.

                           Possible Worlds
Note that these ideas of alternative histories have been covered
by separate disciplines in intellectual history, worth presenting
              A B I Z ARRE ACC O U N T I N G M l: T I-I O D   25


quickly because they all seem to converge on the same concept of
risk and uncertainty (certainty is something that is likely to take
place across the highest number of different alternative histories;
uncertainty concerns events that should take place in the lowest
number of them) .
    In philosophy, there has been considerable work on the subject
starting with Leibniz' idea of possible worlds. For Leibniz, God's
mind included an infinity of possible worlds, of which he selected
just one. These nonselected worlds are worlds of possibilities, and
the one in which I am breathing and writing these lines is just one
of them that happened to have been executed. Philosophers also
have a branch of logic that specializes in the matter: whether some
property holds across all possible worlds or if it holds across a sin­
gle world-with ramifications into the philosophy of language
called possible worlds semantics with such authors as Saul Kripke.
    In physics, there is the many-world interpretation in quantum
mechanics (associated with the works of Hugh Everett in 1 957)
which considers that the universe branches out treelike at each
juncture; what we are living now is only one of these many worlds.
Taken at a more extreme level, whenever numerous viable possi­
bilities exist, the world splits into many worlds, one world for each
different possibility-causing the proliferation of parallel uni­
verses. I am an essayist-trader in one of the parallel universes, plain
dust in another.
    Finally, in economics : Economists studied (perhaps unwit­
tingly) some of the Leibnizian ideas with the possible "states of na­
ture" pioneered by Kenneth Arrow and Gerard Debreu. This
analytical approach to the study of economic uncertainty is called
the "state space" method-it happens to be the cornerstone of
neoclassical economic theory and mathematical finance. A simpli­
fied version is called "scenario analysis," the series of "what-ifs"
used in, say, the forecasting of sales for a fertilizer plant under dif­
 ferent world conditions and demands for the (smelly) product.

                 An Even More Vicious Roulette
Reality is far more vicious than Russian roulette. First, it delivers
the fatal bullet rather infrequently, like a revolver that would have
hundreds, even thousands, of chambers instead of six.After a few
dozen tries, one forgets about the existence of a bullet, under a
numbing false sense of security.The point is dubbed in this book
the black swan problem, which we cover in Chapter 7, as it is
linked to the problem of induction, a problem that has kept a few
thinkers awake at night. It is also related to a problem called deni­
gration of history, as gamblers, investors, and decision-makers feel
that the sorts of things that happen to others would not necessar­
ily happen to them.
    Second, unlike a well-defined, precise game like Russian rou­
lette, where the risks are visible to anyone capable of multiplying
and dividing by six, one does not observe the barrel of reality. Very
rarely is the generator visible to the naked eye. One is thus capa­
ble of unwittingly playing Russian roulette-and calling it by
some alternative "low risk" name.We see the wealth being gener­
ated, never the processor, a matter that makes people lose sight of
their risks, and never consider the losers.The game seems terribly
easy and we play along carelessly.Even scientists with all their so­
phistication in calculating probabilities cannot deliver any mean­
ingful answer about the odds, since knowledge of these depends
on our witnessing the barrel of reality-of which we generally
know nothing.
    Finally, there is an ingratitude factor in warning people about
something abstract (by definition anything that did not happen is
abstract). Say you engage in a business of protecting investors
from rare events by constructing packages that shield them from
their sting ( something I have done on occasion). Say that nothing
happens during the period. Some investors will complain about
your spending their money; some will even try to make you feel
             A B I Z ARRE ACC O U N T I N G M ET H O D   27


sorry: "You wasted my money on insurance last year; the factory
did not burn, it was a stupid expense.You should only insure for
events that happen." One investor came to see me fully expecting
me to be apologetic (it did not work) .But the world is not that ho­
mogeneous: There are some (though very few) who will call you
to express their gratitude and thank you for having protected
them from the events that did not take place.


               S M OOT I-I P EER RELATIONS

The degree of resistance to randomness in one's life is an abstract
idea, part of its logic counterintuitive, and, to confuse matters, its
realizations nonobservable.But I have been increasingly devoted
to it-for a collection of personal reasons I will leave for later.
Clearly my way of judging matters is probabilistic in nature; it re­
lies on the notion of what could have probably happened, and re­
quires a certain mental attitude with respect to one's observations.
I do not recommend engaging an accountant in a discussion about
such probabilistic considerations.For an accountant a number is a
number. If he were interested in probability he would have gotten
involved in more introspective professions-and would be in­
clined to make a costly mistake on your tax return.
   While we do not see the roulette barrel of reality, some people
give it a try; it takes a special mindset to do so. Having seen hun­
dreds of people enter and exit my profession (characterized by ex­
treme dependence on randomness), I have to say that those who
have had a modicum of scientific training tend to go the extra
mile. For many, such thinking is second nature. This might not
necessarily come from their scientific training per se (beware of
causality) , but possibly from the fact that people who have de­
cided at some point in their lives to devote themselves to scientific
research tend to have an ingrained intellectual curiosity and a nat­
ural tendency for such introspection. Particularly thoughtful are
                      28   S O L O N ' S WAR N I N G


those who had to abandon scientific studies because of their in­
ability to keep focused on a narrowly defined problem (or, in
Nero's case, the minute arcane details and petty arguments) .
Without excessive intellectual curiosity it is almost impossible to
complete a Ph.D. thesis these days; but without a desire to nar­
rowly specialize, it is impossible to make a scientific career. (There
is a distinction, however, between the mind of a pure mathemati­
cian thriving on abstraction and that of a scientist consumed by
curiosity. A mathematician is absorbed in what goes into his head
while a scientist searches into what is outside of himself) How­
ever, some people's concern for randomness can be excessive; I
have even seen people trained in some fields, like, say, quantum
mechanics, push the idea to the other extreme, only seeing alter­
native histories (in the many-world interpretation) and ignoring
the one that actually took place.
    Some traders can be unexpectedly introspective about ran­
domness.Not long ago I had dinner at the bar of a Tribeca restau­
rant with Lauren Rose, a trader who was reading an early draft of
this book.We flipped a coin to see who was going to pay for the
meal. I lost and paid. He was about to thank me when he abruptly
stopped and said that he paid for half of it probabilistically.
    I thus view people distributed across two polar categories: On
one extreme, those who never accept the notion of randomness;
on the other, those who are tortured by it.When I started on Wall
Street in the 1980s, trading rooms were populated with people
with a "business orientation, " that is, generally devoid of any intro­
spection, flat as a pancake, and likely to be fooled by randomness.
Their failure rate was extremely high, particularly when financial
instruments gained in complexity. Somehow, tricky products, like
exotic options, were introduced and carried counterintuitive pay­
offs that were too difficult for someone of such culture to handle.
They dropped like flies; I do not think that many of the hundreds
of MBAs of my generation I met on Wall Street in the 1980s still
engage in such forms of professional and disciplined risk taking.

                       Salvation via Aeroflot
The 1990s witnessed the arrival of people of richer and more in­
teresting backgrounds, which made the trading rooms far more
entertaining. I was saved from the conversation of MBAs. Many
scientists, some of them extremely successful in their field, arrived
with a desire to make a buck.They, in turn, hired people who re­
sembled them. While most of these people were not Ph.D.s (in­
deed, the Ph. D. is still a minority) , the culture and values suddenly
changed, becoming more tolerant of intellectual depth. It caused
an increase in the already high demand for scientists on Wall
Street, owing to the rapid development of financial instruments.
The dominant specialty was physics, but one could find all manner
of quantitative backgrounds among them. Russian, French, Chi­
nese, and Indian accents (by order) began dominating in both New
York and London. It was said that every plane from Moscow had
at least its back row full of Russian mathematical physicists en
route to Wall Street (they lacked the street smarts to get good
seats) . One could hire very cheap labor by going to JFK airport
with a (mandatory) translator, randomly interviewing those who
fit the stereotype. Indeed, by the late 1990s one could get some­
one trained by a world-class scientist for almost half the price of
an MBA. As they say, marketing is everything; these guys do not
know how to sell themselves.
  I had a strong bias in favor of Russian scientists; many can be
put to active use as chess coaches (I also got a piano teacher out of
the process) . In addition, they are extremely helpful in the inter­
view process. When MBAs apply for trading positions, they fre­
quently boast "advanced" chess skills on their resumes. I recall the
MBA career counselor at Wharton recommending our advertising
chess skills "because it sounds intelligent and strategic." MBAs, typ­
ically, can interpret their superficial knowledge of the rules of the
game into "expertise." We used to verify the accuracy of claims of
chess expertise (and the character of the applicant) by pulling a
                      30   S O L O N ' S WAR N I N G


chess set out of a drawer and telling the student, now turning pale:
"Yuri will have a word with you."
    The failure rate of these scientists, though, was better, but only
slightly so than that of MBAs; but it came from another reason,
linked to their being on average (but only on average) devoid of
the smallest bit of practical intelligence. Some successful scientists
had the judgment (and social graces) of a doorknob-but by no
means all of them. Many people were capable of the most com­
plex calculations with utmost rigor when it came to equations, but
were totally incapable of solving a problem with the smallest con­
nection to reality; it was as if they understood the letter but not
the spirit of the math (we will see more on such dual thinking
with the two systems of reasoning problem in Chapter 1 1 ) . I am
convinced that X, a likeable Russian man of my acquaintance,
has two brains: one for math and another, considerably inferior
one, for everything else ( which included solving problems related
to the mathematics of finance) . But on occasion a fast-thinking
scientific-minded person with street smarts would emerge. What­
ever the benefits of such population shift, it improved our chess
skills and provided us with quality conversation during lunch­
time-it extended the lunch hour considerably. Consider that I
had in the 1 980s to chat with colleagues who had an MBA or tax
accounting background and were capable of the heroic feat of dis­
cussing FASB standards.I have to say that their interests were not
too contagious. The interesting thing about these physicists did
not lie in their ability to discuss fluid dynamics; it is that they were
naturally interested in a variety of intellectual subjects and pro­
vided pleasant conversation.

                  Solon Visits Regine 's Nightclub
As the reader may already suspect, my opinions about randomness
have not earned me the smoothest of relations with some of my
peers during my Wall Street career (many of whom the reader can
             A B I Z ARRE AC C O U N T I N G M ET I-I O D   31


see indirectly-but only indirectly-portrayed in these chapters) .
But where I had uneven relations was with some of those who had
the misfortune of being my bosses. For I had two bosses in my life
of contrasting characteristics in about every trait.
   The first, whom I will call Kenny, was the epitome of the sub­
urban family man. He would be of the type to coach soccer on
Saturday morning, and invite his brother-in-law for a Sunday af­
ternoon barbecue. He gave the appearance of someone I would
trust with my savings-indeed he rose quite rapidly in the in­
stitution in spite of his lack of technical competence in financial
derivatives (his firm's claim to fame) . But he was too much a no­
nonsense person to make out my logic. He once blamed me for
not being impressed with the successes of some of his traders who
did well during the bull market for European bonds of 199 3 ,
whom I openly considered nothing better than random gun­
slingers.I tried presenting him with the notion of survivorship bias
(Part II of this book) in vain. His traders have all exited the busi­
ness since then "to pursue other interests " (including him) . But he
gave the appearance of being a calm, measured man, who spoke
his mind and knew how to put the other person at ease during a
conversation. He was articulate, extremely presentable thanks to
his athletic looks, well measured in his speech, and endowed with
the extremely rare quality of being an excellent listener.His per­
sonal charm allowed him to win the confidence of the chairman­
but I could not conceal my disrespect, particularly as he could not
make out the nature of my conversation. In spite of his conserva­
tive looks he was a perfect time bomb, ticking away.
   The second, whom I will call Jean-Patrice, in contrast, was a
moody Frenchman with an explosive temper and a hyperaggres­
sive personality. Except for those he truly liked (not that many) ,
he was expert at making his subordinates uncomfortable, putting
them in a state of constant anxiety. He greatly contributed to my
formation as a risk taker; he is one of the very rare people who
                      32   S O L O N ' S WAR N I N G


have the guts to care only about the generator, entirely oblivious
of the results. He presented the wisdom of Solon, but, while one
would expect someone with such personal wisdom and such un­
derstanding of randomness to lead a dull life, he lived a colorful
one.In contrast with Kenny, who wore conservative dark suits and
white shirts (his only indulgence was flashy equestrian Hermes
ties), Jean-Patrice dressed like a peacock: blue shirts, plaid sports
coats stuffed with gaudy silk pocket squares. No family-minded
man, he rarely came to work before noon-though I can safely say
that he carried his work with him to the most unlikely places. He
frequently called me from Regine 's, an upscale nightclub in New
York, waking me up at three in the morning to discuss some small
(and irrelevant) details of my risk exposure. In spite of his slight
corpulence, women seemed to find him irresistible; he frequently
disappeared at midday and was unreachable for hours. His advan­
tage might have been in his being a New York Frenchman with
steady bathing habits. Once he invited me to discuss an urgent
business issue with him. Characteristically, I found him mid­
afternoon in a strange "club" in Paris that carried no nameplate and
where he sat with documents strewn across the table from him.
Sipping champagne, he was simultaneously caressed by two scant­
ily dressed young ladies.Strangely, he involved them in the con­
versation as if they were part of the meeting.He even had one of
the ladies pick up his constantly ringing mobile phone as he did
not want our conversation to be interrupted.
    I am still amazed at this flamboyant man's obsession with risks,
which he constantly played in his head-he literally thought of
everything that could possibly happen. He forced me to make an
alternative plan should a plane crash into the office building (way
before the events of September 2001)-and fumed at my answer
that the financial condition of his department would be of small
interest to me in such circumstances.He had a horrible reputation
as a philanderer, a temperamental boss capable of firing someone
             A B I Z ARRE ACC O U N T I N G M ET I-I O D   33


at a whim, yet he listened to me and understood every word I had
to say, encouraging me to go the extra mile in my study of ran­
domness.He taught me to look for the invisible risks of blowup in
any portfolio. Not coincidentally, he has an immense respect for
science and an almost fawning deference for scientists; a decade or
so after we worked together he showed up unexpectedly during
the defense of my doctoral thesis, smiling from the back of the
room. While Kenny knew how to climb the ladder of an institu­
tion, reaching a high level in the organization before being forced
out, Jean-Patrice did not have such a happy career, a matter that
taught me to beware of mature financial institutions.
   It can be disturbing for many self-styled "bottom line"-oriented
people to be questioned about the histories that did not take place
rather than the ones that actually happened. Clearly, to a no­
nonsense person of the "successful in business" variety, my lan­
guage (and, I have to reckon, some traits of my personality)
appears strange and incomprehensible.To my amusement, the ar­
gument appears offensive to many.
  The contrast between Kenny and Jean-Patrice is not a mere co­
incidence that I happened to witness in a protracted career.Beware
the spendthrift "businesswise" person; the cemetery of markets is
disproportionately well stocked with the self-styled "bottom line"
people. In contrast with their customary Masters of the Universe
demeanor, they suddenly look pale, humble, and hormone­
deprived on the way to the personnel office for the customary dis­
cussion of the severance agreement.

Realism can be punishing. Probabilistic skepticism is worse.It is
difficult to go about life wearing probabilistic glasses, as one starts
seeing fools of randomness all around, in a variety of situations-
                     34   S O L O N ' S WAR N I N G


obdurate in their perceptional illusion.To start, it is impossible to
read a historian's analysis without questioning the inferences: We
know that Hannibal and Hitler were mad in their pursuits, as
Rome is not today Phoenician-speaking and Times Square in New
York currently exhibits no swastikas.But what of all those gener­
als who were equally foolish, but ended up winning the war and
consequently the esteem of the historical chronicler? It is hard to
think of Alexander the Great or Julius Caesar as men who won
only in the visible history, but who could have suffered defeat in
others. If we have heard of them, it is simply because they took
considerable risks, along with thousands of others, and happened
to win. T hey were intelligent, courageous, noble (at times) , had
the highest possible obtainable culture in their day-but so did
thousands of others who live in the musty footnotes of history.
Again I am not contesting that they won their wars-only the
claims concerning the quality of their strategies.(My very first im­
pression upon a recent rereading of the Iliad, the first in my adult­
hood, is that the epic poet did not judge his heroes by the result:
Heroes won and lost battles in a manner that was totally inde­
pendent of their own valor; their fate depended upon totally ex­
ternal forces, generally the explicit agency of the scheming gods
(not devoid of nepotism) . Heroes are heroes because they are
heroic in behavior, not because they won or lost. Patrocles does
not strike us as a hero because of his accomplishments (he was
rapidly killed) but because he preferred to die than s�e Achilles
sulking into inaction. Clearly, the epic poets understood invisible
histories.Also later thinkers and poets had more elaborate meth­
ods for dealing with randomness, as we will see with stoicism.
   Listening to the media, mostly because I am not used to it, can
cause me on occasion to jump out of my seat and become emo­
tional in front of the moving image (I grew up with no television
and was in my late twenties when I learned to operate a TV set).

tories i s provided by the interview that media person George Will,
a "commentator " of the extensively commenting variety, con­
ducted with Professor Robert Shiller, a man known to the public
for his bestselling book ln-ational Exuberance, but known to the
connoisseur for his remarkable insights about the structure of
market randomness and volatility (expressed in the precision of
mathematics).
   The interview is illustrative of the destructive aspect of the
media, in catering to our heavily warped common sense and bi­
ases. I was told that George Will was very famous and extremely
respected (that is, for a journalist). He might even be someone of
the utmost intellectual integrity; his profession, however, is merely
to sound smart and intelligent to the hordes. Shiller, on the other
hand, understands the ins and outs of randomness; he is trained to
deal with rigorous argumentation, but does sound less smart in
public because his subject matter is highly counterintuitive.Shiller
had been pronouncing the stock market to be overpriced for a long
time. George Will indicated to Shiller that had people listened to
him in the past they would have lost money, as the market has
more than doubled since he started pronouncing it overvalued.To
such a journalistic and well-sounding (but senseless) argument,
Shiller was unable to respond except to explain that the fact that
he was wrong in one single market call should not carry undue sig­
nificance.Shiller, as a scientist, did not claim to be a prophet or one
of the entertainers who comment on the markets on the evening
news.Yogi Berra would have had a better time with his confident
comment on the fat lady not having sung yet.
  I could not understand what Shiller, untrained to compress his
ideas into vapid sound bites, was doing on such a TV show.Clearly,
it is foolish to think that an irrational market cannot become even
more irrational; Shiller' s views on the rationality of the market are
not invalidated by the argument that he was wrong in the past.
Here I could not help seeing in the person of George Will the rep-
                     36   S O L O N ' S WA R N I N G


resentative of so many nightmares in my career; my attempting to
prevent someone from playing Russian roulette for $ 10 million
and seeing journalist George Will humiliating me in public by
saying that had the person listened to me it would have cost him
a considerable fortune. In addition, Will's comment was not an
off-the-cuff remark; he wrote an article on the matter discussing
Shiller's bad "prophecy." Such tendency to make and unmake
prophets based on the fate of the roulette wheel is symptomatic
of our ingrained inability to cope with the complex structure of
randomness prevailing in the modern world.Mixing forecast and
prophecy is symptomatic of randomness-foolishness (prophecy
belongs to the right column; forecast is its mere left-column
equivalent) .

                     Humiliated in Debates
Clearly, this idea of alternative history does not make intuitive
sense, which is where the fun begins.For starters, we are not wired
in a way to understand probability, a point that we will examine
backward and forward in this book.I will just say at this point that
researchers of the brain believe that mathematical truths make lit­
tle sense to our mind, particularly when it comes to the examina­
tion of random outcomes.Most results in probability are entirely
counterintuitive; we will see plenty of them.Then why argue with
a mere journalist whose paycheck comes from playing on the con­
ventional wisdom of the hordes? I recall that every time I have
been humiliated in a public discussion on markets by someone (of
the George Will variety) who seemed to present more palatable
and easier-to-understand arguments, I turned out (much later) to
be right. I do not dispute that arguments should be simplified to
their maximum potential; but people often confuse complex ideas
that cannot be simplified into a media-friendly statement as symp­
tomatic of a confused mind.MBAs learn the concept of clarity and
simplicity-the five-minute-manager take on things. T he concept
             A B I Z ARRE ACC O U N T I N G M ET H O D   37


may apply to the business plan for a fertilizer plant, but not to
highly probabilistic arguments-which is the reason I have anec­
dotal evidence in my business that MBAs tend to blow up in fi­
nancial markets, as they are trained to simplify matters a couple of
steps beyond their requirement. (I beg the MBA reader not to take
offense; I am myself the unhappy holder of the degree.)

                 A Different Kind of Earthquake
Try the following experiment. Go to the airport and ask travelers
en route to some remote destination how much they would pay
for an insurance policy paying, say, a million tugrits (the currency
of Mongolia) if they died during the trip (for any reason) .Then ask
another collection of travelers how much they would pay for in­
surance that pays the same in the event of death from a terrorist
act (and only a terrorist act) . Guess which one would command a
higher price? Odds are that people would rather pay for the sec­
ond policy (although the former includes death from terrorism) .
The psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky figured
this out several decades ago.The irony is that one of the sampled
populations did not include people on the street, but professional
predictors attending some society of forecasters' annual meeting.
In a now famous experiment they found that the majority of peo­
ple, whether predictors or nonpredictors, will judge a deadly flood
(causing thousands of deaths) caused by a California earthquake
to be more likely than a fatal ·flood (causing thousands of deaths)
occurring somewhere in North America ( which happens to in­
clude California) .As a derivatives trader I noticed that people do
not like to insure against something abstract; the risk that merits
their attention is always something vivid.
   This brings us to a more dangerous dimension of j ournalism.
We just saw how the scientifically hideous George Will and his
colleagues can twist arguments to sound right without being right.
But there is a more general impact by information providers in bi-
                      38   S O L O N ' S WAR N I N G


asing the representation of the world one gets from the delivered
information. It is a fact that our brain tends to go for superficial
clues when it comes to risk and probability, these clues being
largely determined by what emotions they elicit or the ease with
which they come to mind. In addition to such problems with the
perception of risk, it is also a scientific fact, and a shocking one,
that both risk detection and risk avoidance are not mediated in the
"thinking " part of the brain but largely in the emotional one (the
"risk as feelings " theory) . The consequences are not trivial: It
means that rational thinking has little, very little, to do with risk
avoidance.Much of what rational thinking seems to do is rational­
ize one's actions by fitting some logic to them.
    In that sense the description coming from journalism is cer­
tainly not just an unrealistic representation of the world but rather
the one that can fool you the most by grabbing your attention via
your emotional apparatus-the cheapest to deliver sensation. Take
the mad cow "threat " for example: Over a decade of hype, it only
killed people (in the highest estimates) in the hundreds as com­
pared to car accidents (several hundred thousands'.)-except that
the journalistic description of the latter would not be commer­
cially fruitful. (Note that the risk of dying from food poisoning or
in a car accident on the way to a restaurant is greater than dying
from mad cow disease.) This sensationalism can divert empathy
toward wrong causes: cancer and malnutrition being the ones that
suffer the most from the lack of such attention. Malnutrition in
Africa and Southeast Asia no longer causes the emotional im­
pact-so it literally dropped out of the picture. In that sense the
mental probabilistic map in one's mind is so geared toward the
sensational that one would realize informational gains by dispens­
ing with the news. Another example concerns the volatility of
markets. In people's minds lower prices are far more "volatile "
than sharply higher moves. In addition, volatility seems to be de­
termined not by the actual moves but by the tone of the media.

The market movements in the eighteen months after September
1 1 , 200 1 , were far smaller than the ones that we faced in the
eighteen months prior-but somehow in the mind of investors
they were very volatile. The discussions in the media of the "ter­
rorist threats" magnified the effect of these market moves in peo­
ple's heads. This is one of the many reasons that journalism may be
the greatest plague we face today-as the world becomes more
and more complicated and our minds are trained for more and
more simplification.

                           Proverbs Galore
Beware the confusion between correctness and intelligibility. Part
of conventional wisdom favors things that can be explained rather
instantly and "in a nutshell"-in many circles it is considered law.
Having attended a French elementary school, a lycee primaire, I
was trained to rehash Boileau's adage:


  Ce qui se conroit bien s 'enonce clairement
  Et les mots pour le dire viennent aisement


What is easy to conceive is clear to express I Words to say it would
come effortlessly.
  The reader can imagine my disappointment at realizing, while
growing up as a practitioner of randomness, that most poetic
sounding adages are plain wrong. Borrowed wisdom can be vi­
cious. I need to make a huge effort not to be swayed by well­
sounding remarks. I remind myself of Einstein 's remark that
common sense is nothing but a collection of misconceptions ac­
quired by age eighteen. Furthermore, What sounds intelligent in a
conversation or a meeting, or, particularly, in the media, is suspicious.
   Any reading of the history of science would show that almost
all the _smart things that have been proven by science appeared
like lunacies at the time they were first discovered. Try to explain
                     40   S O L O N ' S WA R N I N G


to a Times (of London) journalist in 1905 that time slows down
when one travels (even the Nobel committee never granted Ein­
stein the prize on account of his insight on special relativity) . Or
to someone with no exposure to physics that there are places in
our universe where time does not exist.Try to explain to Kenny
that, although his star trader "proved" to be extremely successful,
I have enough arguments to convince him that he is a dangerous
idiot.

                          Risk Managers
Corporations and financial institutions have recently created the
strange position of risk manager, someone who is supposed to
monitor the institution and verify that it is not too deeply in­
volved in the business of playing Russian roulette. Clearly, having
been burned a few times, the incentive is there to have someone
take a look at the generator, the roulette that produces the profits
and losses.Although it is more fun to trade, many extremely smart
people among my friends (including Jean-Patrice) felt attracted by
such positions. It is an important and attractive fact that the aver­
age risk manager earns more than the average trader (particularly
when we take into account the number of traders thrown out of
the business: While a ten-year survival rate for a trader is in the
single digits, that of a risk manager is close to 100%) . "Traders
come and go; risk managers are here to stay." I keep thinking of
taking such a position both on economic grounds (as it is proba­
bilistically more profitable) and because the job offers more intel­
lectual content than the one consisting in just buying and selling,
and allows one to integrate research and execution.Finally, a risk
manager's blood has smaller quantities of the harmful kind of
stress hormones.But something has held me back, aside from the
irrationality of wanting the pains and entertainment from the
emotions of speculation. T he risk managers' job feels strange: As
we said, the generator of reality is not observable.T hey are limited
              A B I Z ARRE ACC O U N T I N G M E T I-I O D   41


in their power to stop profitable traders from taking risks, given
that they would, ex post, be accused by the George Wills around of
costing the shareholder some precious opportunity shekels. On
the other hand, the occurrence of a blowup would cause them to
be responsible for it.What to do in such circumstances?
   Their focus becomes to play politics, cover themselves by issu­
ing vaguely phrased internal memoranda that warn against risk­
taking activities yet stop short of completely condemning it, lest
they lose their job.Like a doctor torn between the two types of er­
rors, the false positive (telling the patient he has cancer when in
fact he does not) and the false negative (telling the patient he is
healthy when in fact he has cancer) , they need to balance their ex­
istence with the fact that they inherently need some margin of
error in their business.

                             Epiphenomena
From the standpoint of an institution, the existence of a risk man­
ager has less to do with actual risk reduction than it has to do with
the impression of risk reduction. Philosophers since Hume and
modern psychologists have been studying the concept of epiphe­
nomenalism, or when one has the illusion of cause-and-effect.
Does the compass move the boat? By "watching " your risks, are
you effectively reducing them or are you giving yourself the feel­
ing that you are doing your duty? Are you like a chief executive
officer or just an observing press officer? Is such illusion of control
harmful?
   I conclude the chapter with a presentation of the central para­
dox of my career in financial randomness. By definition, I go
against the grain, so it should come as no surprise that my style
and methods are neither popular nor easy to understand. But I
have a dilemma: On the one hand, I work with others in the real
world, and the real world is not just populated with babbling but
ultimately inconsequential journalists. So my wish is for people in
                     42   S O L O N ' S WAR N I N G


general to remain fools of randomness (so I can trade against
them) , yet for there to remain a minority intelligent enough to
value my methods and hire my services. In other words, I need
people to remain fools of randomness, but not all of them. I was
fortunate to meet Donald Sussman, who corresponds to such an
ideal partner; he helped me in the second stage of my career by
freeing me from the ills of employment. My greatest risk is to be­
come successful, as it would mean that my business is about to
disappear; strange business, ours.

                    Europlayboy Mathematics
      he stereotype of a pure mathematician presents an anemic
      man with a shaggy beard and grimy and uncut fingernails
       silently laboring on a Spartan but disorganized desk. With
thin shoulders and a pot belly, he sits in a grubby office, totally ab­
sorbed in his work, oblivious to the grunginess of his surroundings.
He grew up in a communist regime and speaks English with an as­
tringent and throaty Eastern European accent. When he eats,
crumbs of food accumulate in his beard. With time he becomes
more and more absorbed in his subject matter of pure theorems,
reaching levels of ever increasing abstraction. The American public
                      44   S O LO N ' S WA R N I N G


was recently exposed to one of these characters with the Una­
bomber, the bearded and recluse mathematician who lived in a hut
and took to murdering people who promoted modern technology.
No journalist was capable of even coming close to describing the
subject matter of his thesis, "Complex Boundaries, " as it has no in­
telligible equivalent-a complex number being an entirely abstract
and imaginary number that includes the square root of minus one,
an object that has no analog outside of the world of mathematics.
    The name Monte Carlo conjures up the image of a suntanned ur­
bane man of the Europlayboy variety entering a casino under a whiff
of the Mediterranean breeze.He is an apt skier and tennis player, but
also can hold his own in chess and bridge.He drives a gray sports car,
dresses in a well-ironed Italian handmade suit, and speaks carefully
and smoothly about mundane, but real, matters, those a journalist
can easily describe to the public in compact sentences. Inside the
casino he astutely counts the cards, mastering the odds, and bets in a
studied manner, his mind producing precise calculations of his opti­
mal betting size.He could be James Bond's smarter lost brother.
    Now when I think of Monte Carlo mathematics, I think of a
happy combination of the two: The Monte Carlo man's realism
without the shallowness, combined with the mathematician's in­
tuitions without the excessive abstraction. For indeed this branch
of mathematics is of immense practical use-it does not present
the same dryness commonly associated with mathematics. I be­
came addicted to it the minute I became a trader. It shaped my
thinking in most matters related to randomness. Most of the ex­
amples used in this book were created with my Monte Carlo gen­
erator, which I introduce in this chapter. Yet it is far more a way of
thinking than a computational method. Mathematics is princi­
pally a tool to meditate, rather than to compute.

                              The Tools
The notion of alternative histories discussed in the last chapter can
be extended considerably and subjected to all manner of technical
       A M AT I-I E M AT I CA L M E D I TAT I O N O N I-I I S T O R V   45


refinement. This brings us to the tools used in my profession to toy
with uncertainty. I will outline them next. Monte Carlo methods,
in brief, consist of creating artificial history using the following
concepts.
  First, consider the sample path. The invisible histories have a
scientific name, alternative sample paths, a name borrowed from
the field of mathematics of probability called stochastic processes.
The notion of path, as opposed to outcome, indicates that it is not
a mere MBA-style scenario analysis, but the examination of a se­
quence of scenarios along the course of time. We are not j ust con­
cerned with where a bird can end up tomorrow night, but rather
with all the various places it can possibly visit during the time in­
terval. We are not concerned with what the investor's worth
would be in, say, a year, but rather of the heart-wrenching rides he
may experience during that period. The word sample stresses that
one sees only one realization among a collection of possible ones.
Now, a sample path can be either deterministic or random, which
brings the next distinction.
   A random sample path, also called a random run, is the mathe­
matical name for such a succession of virtual historical events,
starting at a given date and ending at another, except that they are
subjected to some varying level of uncertainty. However, the word
random should not be mistaken for equiprobable (i.e., having the
same probability) . Some outcomes will give a higher probability
than others. An exa�ple of a random sample path can be the body
temperature of your explorer cousin during his latest bout with
typhoid fever, measured hourly from the beginning to the end of
his episode.It can also be a simulation of the price of your favorite
technology stock, measured daily at the close of the market, over,
say, one year. Starting at $ 100, in one scenario it can end up at $20
having seen a high of $ 220; in another it can end up at $ 14 5 hav­
ing seen a low of $ 10. Another example is the evolution of your
wealth during an evening at a casino.You start with $ 1, 000 in your
pocket, and measure it every fifteen minutes. In one sample path
                       46   S O L O N ' S WAR N I N G


you have $2, 200 at midnight; in another you barely have $20 left
for a cab fare.
    Stochastic processes refer to the dynamics of events unfolding
with the course of time. Stochastic is a fancy Greek name for ran­
dom. This branch of probability concerns itself with the study of
the evolution of successive random events-one could call it the
mathematics of history. The key about a process is that it has time
in it.
    What is a Monte Carlo generator? Imagine that you can repli­
cate a perfect roulette wheel in your attic without having recourse
to a carpenter. Computer programs can be written to simulate just
about anything. They are even better (and cheaper) than the
roulette wheel built by your carpenter, as this physical version
may be inclined to favor one number more than others owing to a
possible slant in its build or the floor of your attic. These are called
the biases.
    Monte Carlo simulations are closer to a toy than anything I have
seen in my adult life. One can generate thousands, perhaps mil­
lions, of random sample paths, and look at the prevalent character­
istics of some of their features. The assistance of the computer is
instrumental in such studies. The glamorous reference to Monte
Carlo indicates the metaphor of simulating the random events in
the manner of a virtual casino. Ont;> sets conditions believed to re­
semble the ones that prevail in reality, and launches a collection of
simulations around possible events. With no mathematical literacy
we can launch a Monte Carlo simulation of an eighteen-year-old
Christian Lebanese successively playing Russian roulette for a
given sum, and see how many of these attempts result in enrich­
ment, or how long it takes on average before he hits the obituary.
We can change the barrel to contain 500 holes, a matter that
would decrease the probability of death, and see the results.
    Monte Carlo simulation methods were pioneered in martial
physics in the Los Alamos laboratory during the A-bomb prepara-
       A M AT H E M AT I CA L M E D I TAT I O N O N H I S T O R Y   47


tion.They became popular in financial mathematics in the 1 980s,
particularly in the theories of the random walk of asset prices.
Clearly, we have to say that the example of Russian roulette does
not need such apparatus, but many problems, particularly those
resembling real-life situations, require the potency of a Monte
Carlo simulator.

                     Monte Carlo Mathematics
It is a fact that "true " mathematicians do not like Monte Carlo
methods.They believe that they rob us of the finesse and elegance
of mathematics. They call it "brute force." For we can replace a
large portion of mathematical knowledge with a Monte Carlo
simulator (and other computational tricks) .For instance, someone
with no formal knowledge of geometry can compute the mysteri­
ous, almost mystical Pi. How? By drawing a circle inside of a
square, and "shooting " random bullets into the picture (as in an ar­
cade) , specifying equal probabilities of hitting any point on the
map (something called a uniform distribution). The ratio of bul­
lets inside the circle divided by those inside and outside the circle
will deliver a multiple of the mystical Pi, with possibly infinite
precision. Clearly, this is not an efficient use of a computer as Pi
can be computed analytically, that is, in a mathematical form, but
the method can give some users more intuition about the subject
matter than lines of equations. Some people's brains and intu­
itions are oriented in such a way that they are more capable of get­
ting a point in such a manner (I count myself one of those) . The
computer might not be natural to our human brain; neither is
mathematics.
   I am not a "native" mathematician, that is, I am someone who
does not speak mathematics as a native language, but someone
who speaks it with a trace of a foreign accent.For I am not inter­
ested in mathematical properties per se, only in the application,
while a mathematician would be interested in improving mathe-
                      48   S O L O N ' S WA R N I N G


matics (via theorems and proofs) .I proved incapable of concen­
trating on deciphering a single equation unless I was motivated by
a real problem (with a modicum of greed) ; thus most of what I
know comes from derivatives trading-options pushed me to
study the math of probability. Many compulsive gamblers, who
otherwise would be of middling intelligence, acquire remarkable
card-counting skills thanks to their passionate greed.
   Another analogy would be with grammar; mathematics is often
tedious and insightless grammar. There are those who are inter­
ested in grammar for grammar's sake, and those interested in
avoiding solecisms while writing documents. Those of us in the
second category are called "quants"-like physicists, we have more
interest in the employment of the mathematical tool than in the
tool itself Mathematicians are born, never made. Physicists and
quants too.I do not care about the "elegance" and "quality" of the
mathematics I use so long as I can get the point right. I have re­
course to Monte Carlo machines whenever I can.They can get the
work done.They are also far more pedagogical, and I will use them
in this book for the examples.
    Indeed, probability is an introspective field of inquiry, as it af­
fects more than one science, particularly the mother of all sciences:
that of knowledge. It is impossible to assess the quality of the
knowledge we are gathering without allowing a share of random­
ness in the manner it is obtained and cleaning the argument from
the chance coincidence that could have seeped into its construc­
tion.In science, probability and information are treated in exactly
the same manner.Literally every great thinker has dabbled with it,
most of them obsessively. The two greatest minds to me, Einstein
and Keynes, both started their intellectual journeys with it. Ein­
stein wrote a maj or paper in 1905, in which he was almost the first
to examine in probabilistic terms the succession of random events,
namely the evolution of suspended particles in a stationary liquid.
His article on the theory of the Brownian movement can be used
        A M AT I-I E M AT I CA L M E D I TAT I O N O N I-I I S T O R Y   49


as the backbone of the random walk approach used in financial
modeling.As for Keynes, to the literate person he is not the politi­
cal economist that tweed-clad leftists love to quote, but the author
of the magisterial, introspective, and potent Treatise on Probability.
For before his venturing into the murky field of political economy,
Keynes was a probabilist.He also had other interesting attributes
(he blew up trading his account after experiencing excessive opu­
lence-people's understanding of probability does not translate
into their behavior) .
   The reader can guess that the next step from such probabilistic
introspection is to get drawn into philosophy, particularly the
branch of philosophy that concerns itself with knowledge, called
epistemology or methodology, or philosophy of science.We will
not get into the topic until later in the book.

                               Making History
In the early 1990s, like many of my friends in quantitative finance,
I became addicted to the various Monte Carlo engines, which I
taught myself to build, thrilled to feel that I was generating his­
tory, a Demiurgus. It can be electrifying to generate virtual histo­
ries and watch the dispersion between the various results. Such
dispersion is indicative of the degree of resistance to randomness.
This is where I am convinced that I have been extremely lucky in
my choice of career: One of the attractive aspects of my profession
as a quantitative option trader is that I have close to 95% of my
day free to think, read, and research (or "reflect" in the gym, on ski
slopes, or, more effectively, on a park bench) .I also had the privi­
lege of frequently "working" from my well-equipped attic.
   The dividend of the computer revolution to us did not come in

pable of generating a million sample paths per minute.Recall that
I never considered myself better than an unenthusiastic equation
solver and was rarely capable of prowess in the matter-being bet­
ter at setting up equations than solving them.Suddenly, my engine
allowed me to solve with minimal effort the most intractable of
equations.Few solutions became out of reach.

                    Zorglubs Crowding the Attic
My Monte Carlo engine took me on a few interesting adventures.
While my colleagues were immersed in news stories, central bank
announcements, earnings reports, economic forecasts, sports re­
sults, and, not least, office politics, I started toying with it in fields
bordering my home base of financial probability.A natural field of
expansion for the amateur is evolutionary biology-the universal­
ity of its message and its application to markets are appealing.I
started simulating populations of fast-mutating animals called
Zorglubs under climatic changes and witnessing the most unex­
pected of conclusions-some of the results are recycled in Chap­
ter 5 .My aim, as a pure amateur fleeing the boredom of business
life, was merely to develop intuitions for these events-the sort of
intuitions that amateurs build away from the overly detailed so­
phistication of the professional researcher. I also toyed with mo­
lecular biology, generating randomly occurring cancer cells and
witnessing some surprising aspects of their evolution. Naturally
the analog to fabricating populations of Zorglubs was to simu­
late a population of "idiotic bull," "impetuous bear," and "cautious"
traders under different market regimes, say booms and busts, and
to examine their short-term and long-term survival.Under such a
structure, "idiotic bull" traders who get rich from the rally would
use the proceeds to buy more assets, driving prices higher, until
their ultimate shellacking.Bearish traders, though, rarely made it
in the boom to get to the bust.My models showed that ultimately
almost nobody really survived; bears dropped out like flies in the
       A M A T H E M AT I CA L M E D I TAT I O N O N H I S T O R Y   51


rally and bulls ended up being slaughtered, as paper profits van­
ished when the music stopped.But there was one exception; some
of those who traded options (I called them option buyers) had re­
markable staying power and I wanted to be one of those. How?
Because they could buy the insurance against blowup; they could
get anxiety-free sleep at night, thanks to the knowledge that if
their careers were threatened, it would not be owing to the out­
come of a single day.
  If the tone of this book seems steeped in the culture of Darwin­
ism and evolutionary thinking, it does not come from any remotely
formal training in the natural sciences, but from the evolutionary
way of thinking taught by my Monte Carlo simulators.
   I reckon that I outgrew the desire to generate random runs
every time I want to explore an idea-but by dint of playing with
a Monte Carlo engine for years I can no longer visualize a realized
outcome without reference to the nonrealized ones. I call that
"summing under histories, " borrowing the expression from the
colorful physicist Richard Feynman who applied such methods to
examine the dynamics of subatomic particles.
  Using my Monte Carlo to make and remake history reminded
me of the experimental novels (the so-called new novels) by such
writers as Alain Robbe-Grillet, popular in the 1960s and 19 70s.
There the same chapter would be written and revised, the writer
each time changing the plot like a new sample path. Somehow the
author was freed from the past situation he helped create and al­
lowed himself the indulgence to change the plot retroactively.

                        Denigration of History
One more word on history seen from a Monte Carlo perspective.
The wisdom of such classical stories as Solon's prods me to spend
even more time in the company of the classical historians, even if
the stories, like Solon's warning, have benefited from the patina of
time. However, this goes against the grain: Learning from history
                      52   S O L O N ' S WARN I N G


does not come naturally to us humans, a fact that is so visible in
the endless repetitions of identically configured booms and busts
in modern markets.By history I refer to the anecdotes, not the his­
torical theorizing, the grand-scale historicism that aims to inter­
pret events with theories based on uncovering some laws in the
evolution of history-the sort of Hegelianism and pseudoscien­
tific historicism leading to such calls as the end of history (it is
pseudoscientific because it draws theories from past events with­
out allowing for the fact that such combinations of events might
have arisen from randomness; there is no way to verify the claims
in a controlled experiment) .For me, history is of use merely at the
level of my desired sensibility, affecting the way I would wish to
think by reference to past events, by being able to better steal the
ideas of others and leverage them, correct the mental defect that
seems to block my ability to learn from others. It is the respect of
the elders that I would like to develop, reinforcing the awe I in­
stinctively feel for people with gray hair, but that has eroded in
my life as a trader where age and success are somewhat divorced.
Indeed, I have two ways of learning from history: from the past,
by reading the elders; and from the future, thanks to my Monte
Carlo toy.

                           The Stove Is Hot
As I mentioned above, it is not natural for us to learn from history.
We have enough clues to believe that our human endowment does
not favor transfers of experience in a cultural way but through se­
lection of those who bear some favorable traits. It is a platitude
that children learn only from their own mistakes; they will cease to
touch a burning stove only when they are themselves burned; no
possible warning by others can lead to developing the smallest
form of cautiousness.Adults, too, suffer from such a condition.
This point has been examined by behavioral economics pioneers
Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky with regard to the choices
        A M AT ME M AT I CA L M E D I TAT I O N O N M I S T O R Y   53


people make in selecting risky medical treatments-I myself have
seen it in my being extremely lax in the area of detection and pre­
vention (i.e., I refuse to derive my risks from the probabilities com­
puted on others, feeling that I am somewhat special) yet extremely
aggressive in the treatment of medical conditions (I overreact
when I am burned), which is not coherent with rational behavior
under uncertainty. This congenital denigration of the experience of
others is not limited to children or to people like myself; it affects
business decision makers and investors on a grand scale.
   If you think that merely reading history books would help you
learn "from other's mistakes, " consider the following nineteenth­
century experiment. In a well-known psychology case the Swiss
doctor Claparede had an amnesic patient completely crippled
with her ailment.Her condition was so bad that he would have to
reintroduce himself to her at a frequency of once per fifteen min­
utes for her to remember who he was.One day he secreted a pin
in his hand before shaking hers. The next day she quickly with­
drew her hand as he tried to greet her, but still did not recognize
him. Since then plenty of discussions of amnesic patients show
some form of learning on the part of people without their being
aware of it and without it being stored in conscious memory. The
scientific name of the distinction between the two memories, the
conscious and the nonconscious, is declarative and nondeclarative.
Much of the risk avoidance that comes from experiences is part of
the second.The only way I developed a respect for history is by
making myself aware of the fact that I was not programmed to
learn from it in a textbook format.
   Actually, things can be worse than that: In some respects we do
not learn from our own history. Several branches of research have
been examining our inability to learn from our own reactions to
past events: For example, people fail to learn that their emotional
reactions to past experiences (positive or negative) were short­
lived-yet they continuously retain the bias of thinking that the
                      54   S O L O N ' S WAR N I N G


purchase of an object will bring long-lasting, possibly permanent,
happiness or that a setback will cause severe and prolonged dis­
tress (when in the past similar setbacks did not affect them for
very long and the joy of the purchase was short-lived).
   All of my colleagues who I have known to denigrate history
blew up spectacularly-and I have yet to encounter some such
person who has not blown up. But the truly interesting point lies
in the remarkable similarities in their approaches. The blowup, I
will repeat, is different from merely incurring a monetary loss; it is
losing money when one does not believe that such fact is possible
at all. There is nothing wrong with a risk taker taking a hit pro­
vided one declares that one is a risk taker rather than that the risk
being taken is small or nonexistent. Characteristically, blown-up
traders think that they knew enough about the world to reject the
possibility of the adverse event taking place: There was no courage
in their taking such risks, just ignorance. I have noticed plenty of
analogies between those who blew up in the stock market crash of
1987, those who blew up in the Japan meltdown of 1990, those
who blew up in the bond market debacle of 1994, those who blew
up in Russia in 1998, and those who blew up shorting Nasdaq
stocks.They all made claims to the effect that "these times are dif­
ferent " or that "their market was different, " and offered seemingly
well-constructed, intellectual arguments (of an economic nature)
to justify their claims; they were unable to accept that the experi­
ence of others was out there, in the open, freely available to all,
with books detailing crashes in every bookstore.Aside from these
generalized systemic blowups, I have seen hundreds of option
traders forced to leave the business after blowing up in a stupid
manner, in spite of warnings by the veterans, similar to a child's
touching the stove.This I find to resemble my own personal atti­
tude with respect to the detection and prevention of the variety of
ailments I may be subjected to.Every man believes himself to be
quite different, a matter that amplifies the "why me? " shock upon
a diagnosis.

                  Skills in Predicting Past History
We can discuss this point from different angles. Experts call one
manifestation of such denigration of history historical detenninism.
In a nutshell we think that we would know when history is made;
we believe that people who, say, witnessed the stock market crash
of 1929 knew then that they lived an acute historical event and
that, should these events repeat themselves, they too would know
about such facts. Life for us is made to resemble an adventure
movie, as we know ahead of time that something big is about to
happen. It is hard to imagine that people who witnessed history
did not know at the time how important the moment was. Some­
how all respect we may have for history does not translate well
into our treatment of the present.
   Jean-Patrice of the last chapter was abruptly replaced by an in­
teresting civil servant type who had never been involved in the
randomness professions. He just went to the right civil servant
schools where people learn to write reports and had some senior
managerial position in the institution. As is typical with subjec­
tively assessed positions he tried to make his predecessor look bad:
Jean-Patrice was deemed sloppy and unprofessional.The civil ser­
vant's first undertaking was to run a formal analysis of our trans­
actions; he found that we traded a little too much, incurring very
large back office expenditure.He analyzed a large segment of for­
eign exchange traders' transactions, then wrote a report explaining
that only close to l % of these transactions generated significant
profits; the rest generated either losses or small profits. He was
shocked that the traders did not do more of the winners and less
of the losers.It was obvious to him that we needed to comply with
these instructions immediately. If we just doubled the winners, the
results for the institution would be so great. How come you highly
paid traders did not think about it before?
   Things are always obvious after the fact. The civil servant was a
very intelligent person, and this mistake is much more prevalent
                      56   S O L O N ' S WAR N I N G


than one would think.It has to do with the way our mind handles
historical information.When you look at the past, the past will al­
ways be deterministic, since only one single observation took
place.Our mind will interpret most events not with the preceding
ones in mind, but the following ones. Imagine taking a test know­
ing the answer.While we know that history flows forward, it is dif­
ficult to realize that we envision it backward.Why is it so? We will
discuss the point in Chapter 11 but here is a possible explanation:
Our minds are not quite designed to understand how the world
works, but, rather, to get out of trouble rapidly and have progeny.
If they were made for us to understand things, then we would
have a machine in it that would run the past history as in a VCR,
with a correct chronology, and it would slow us down so much
that we would have trouble operating.Psychologists call this over­
estimation of what one knew at the time of the event due to sub­
sequent information the hindsight bias, the "I knew it all along"
effect.
   Now the civil servant called the trades that ended up as losers
"gross mistakes," just like journalists call decisions that end up
costing a candidate his election a "mistake." I will repeat this point
until I get hoarse: A mistake is not something to be determined
after the fact, but in the light of the information until that point.
   A more vicious effect of such hindsight bias is that those who
are very good at predicting the past will think of themselves as
good at predicting the future, and feel confident about their abil­
ity to do so.This is why events like those of September 11, 2001,
never teach us that we live in a world where important events are
not predictable-even the Twin Towers' collapse appears to have
been predictable then.

                              My Solon
I have another reason to be obsessed with Solon's warning. I hark
back to the very same strip of land in the Eastern Mediterranean
        A M AT l -lE M AT I CA L M E D I TAT I O N O N I-I I S T O R Y   57


where the story took place. My ancestors experienced bouts of ex­
treme opulence and embarrassing penury over the course of a sin­
gle generation, with abrupt regressions that people around me
who have the memory of steady and linear betterment do not
think feasible (at least not at the time of writing) . Those around
me either have (so far) had few family setbacks (except for the
Great Depression) or, more generally, are not suffused with enough
sense of history to reflect backward.For people of my background,
Eastern Mediterranean Greek Orthodox and invaded Eastern
Roman citizens, it was as if our soul had been wired with the re­
membrance of that sad spring day circa 500 years ago when Con­
stantinople, under the invading Turks, fell out of history, leaving us
the lost subjects of a dead empire, very prosperous minorities in an
Islamic world-but with an extremely fragile wealth. Moreover, I
vividly remember the image of my own dignified grandfather, a
former deputy prime minister and son of a deputy prime minister
(whom I never saw without a suit), residing in a nondescript
apartment in Athens, his estate having been blown up during the
Lebanese civil war. Incidentally, having experienced the ravages of
war, I find undignified impoverishment far harsher than physical
danger (somehow dying in full dignity appears to me far prefer­
able to living a janitorial life, which is one of the reasons I dislike
financial risks far more than physical ones) .I am certain that Croe­
sus worried more about the loss of his Kingdom than the perils to
his life.
   There is an important and nontrivial aspect of historical think­
ing, perhaps more applicable to the markets than anything else:
Unlike many "hard" sciences, history cannot lend itself to experi­
mentation.But somehow, overall, history is potent enough to de­
liver, on time, in the medium to long run, most of the possible
scenarios, and to eventually bury the bad guy. Bad trades catch up
with you, it is frequently said in the markets. Mathematicians of
probability give that a fancy name: ergodicity. It means, roughly,
                      58   S O L O N ' S WAR N I N G


that (under certain conditions) very long sample paths would end
up resembling each other.The properties of a very, very long sam­
ple path would be similar to the Monte Carlo properties of an
average of shorter ones. The janitor in Chapter 1 who won the lot­
tery, if he lived one thousand years, cannot be expected to win
more lotteries. Those who were unlucky in life in spite of their
skills would eventually rise. The lucky fool might have benefited
from some luck in life; over the longer run he would slowly con­
verge to the state of a less-lucky idiot. Each one would revert to
his long-term properties.

                           Breaking News
The journalist, my bete noire, entered this book with George Will
dealing with random outcomes. In the next step I will show how
my Monte Carlo toy taught me to favor distilled thinking, by
which I mean the thinking based on information around us that is
stripped of meaningless but diverting clutter. For the difference
between noise and information, the topic of this book (noise has
more randomness) has an analog: that between journalism and
history. To be competent, a journalist should view matters like a
historian, and play down the value of the information he is pro­
viding, such as by saying: "Today the market went up, but this in­
formation is not too relevant as it emanates mostly from noise." He
would certainly lose his job by trivializing the value of the infor­
mation in his hands. Not only is it difficult for the journalist to
think more like a historian, but it is, alas, the historian who is be­
coming more like the journalist.
    For an idea, age is beauty (it is premature to discuss the math­
ematics of the point) .The applicability of Solon's warning to a life
in randomness, in contrast with the exact opposite message deliv­
ered by the prevailing media-soaked culture, reinforces my in-
        A M AT I-I E M AT I CA L M E D I TAT I O N O N I-I I S T O R Y   59


stinct to value distilled thought over newer thinking, regardless of
its apparent sophistication-another reason to accumulate the
hoary volumes by my bedside (I confess that the only news items
I currently read are the far more interesting upscale social gossip
stories found in Tatler, Paris Match, and Vanity Fair-in addition to
The Economist) .Aside from the decorum of ancient thought as op­
posed to the coarseness of fresh ink, I have spent some time phras­
ing the idea in the mathematics of evolutionary arguments and
conditional probability.For an idea to have survived so long across
so many cycles is indicative of its relative fitness. Noise, at least
some noise, was filtered out. Mathematically, progress means that
some new information is better than past information, not that
the average of new information will supplant past information,
which means that it is optimal for someone, when in doubt, to sys­
tematically reject the new idea, information, or method. Clearly
and shockingly, always.Why?
  The argument in favor of "new things " and even more "new new
things " goes as follows: Look at the dramatic changes that have
been brought about by the arrival of new technologies, such as the
automobile, the airplane, the telephone, and the personal com­
puter. Middlebrow inference (inference stripped of probabilistic
thinking) would lead one to believe that all new technologies and
inventions would likewise revolutionize our lives. But the answer
is not so obvious: Here we only see and count the winners, to the
exclusion of the losers (it is like saying that actors and writers are
rich, ignoring the fact that actors are largely waiters-and lucky to
be ones, for the less comely writers usually serve French fries at
McDonald's) .Losers? The Saturday newspaper lists dozens of new
patents of such items that can revolutionize our lives.People tend
to infer that because some inventions have revolutionized our lives
that inventions are good to endorse and we should favor the new
over the old. I hold the opposite view. The opportunity cost of
missing a "new new thing " like the airplane and the automobile is
                      60   S O L O N ' S WAR N I N G


minuscule compared to the toxicity of all the garbage one has to
go through to get to these jewels (assuming these have brought
some improvement to our lives, which I frequently doubt) .
    Now the exact same argument applies to information. The
problem with information is not that it is diverting and generally
useless, but that it is toxic. We will examine the dubious value of
the highly frequent news with a more technical discussion of sig­
nal filtering and observation frequency farther down. I will say
here that such respect for the time-honored provides arguments
to rule out any commerce with the babbling modern journalist
and implies a minimal exposure to the media as a guiding princi­
ple for someone involved in decision making under uncertainty.If
there is anything better than noise in the mass of "urgent" news
pounding us, it would be like a needle in a haystack. People do not
realize that the media is paid to get your attention. For a journal­
ist, silence rarely surpasses any word.
    On the rare occasions when I boarded the 6: 4 2 train to New
York I observed with amazement the hordes of depressed business
commuters (who seemed to prefer to be elsewhere) studiously
buried in The Wall Street Journal, apprised of the minutiae of com­
panies that, at the time of writing now, are probably out of busi­
ness.Indeed it is difficult to ascertain whether they seem depressed
because they are reading the newspaper, or if depressive people
tend to read the newspaper, or if people who are living outside
their genetic habitat both read the newspaper and look sleepy and
depressed. But while early on in my career such focus on noise
would have offended me intellectually, as I would have deemed
such information as too statistically insignificant for the derivation
of any meaningful conclusion, I currently look at it with delight. I
am happy to see such mass-scale idiotic decision making, prone to
overreaction in their postperusal investment orders-in other
words I currently see in the fact that people read such material an
insurance for my continuing in the entertaining business of option
        A M AT l-l !; M AT I CA L M !; D I TAT I O N O N I-I I S T O R Y   61


trading against the fools o f randomness. (It takes a huge invest­
ment in introspection to learn that the thirty or more hours spent
"studying" the news last month neither had any predictive ability
during your activities of that month nor did it impact your current
knowledge of the world.This problem is similar to the weaknesses
in our ability to correct for past errors: Like a health club mem­
bership taken out to satisfy a New Year's resolution, people often
think that it will surely be the next batch of news that will really
make a difference to their understanding of things.)

                                 Shiller Redux
Much of the thinking about the negative value of information
on society in general was sparked by Robert Shiller. Not just in
financial markets; but overall his 1981 paper may be the first
mathematically formulated introspection on the manner in which
society in general handles information. Shiller made his mark with
his 1981 paper on the volatility of markets, where he determined
that if a stock price is the estimated value of "something" (say the
discounted cash flows from a corporation) , then market prices are
way too volatile in relation to tangible manifestations of that
"something" (he used dividends as proxy) . Prices swing more than
the fundamentals they are supposed to reflect, they visibly overre­
act by being too high at times (when their price overshoots the
good news or when they go up without any marked reason) or too
low at others.The volatility differential between prices and infor­
mation meant that something about "rational expectation" did not
work. (Prices did not rationally reflect the long-term value of se­
curities and were overshooting in either direction.) Markets had to
be wrong. Shiller then pronounced markets to be not as efficient
as established by financial theory (efficient markets meant, in a
nutshell, that prices should adapt to all available information in
such a way as to be totally unpredictable to us humans and pre­
vent people from deriving profits) .This conclusion set off calls by
                       62   S O L O N ' S WAR N I N G


the religious orders of high finance for the destruction of the infi­
del who committed such apostasy. Interestingly, and by some
strange coincidence, it is that very same Shiller who was trounced
by George Will only one chapter ago.
   The principal criticism against Shiller came from Robert C.
Merton. The attacks were purely on methodological grounds
(Shiller's analysis was extremely rough; for instance, his using div­
idends in place of earnings was rather weak) . Merton was also de­
fending the official financial theory position that m arkets needed
to be efficient and could not possibly deliver opportunities on a
silver plate. Yet the same Robert C. Merton later introduced him­
self as the "founding partner" of a hedge fund that aimed at taking
advantage of market inefficiencies. Setting aside the fact that Mer­
ton's hedge fund blew up rather spectacularly from the black swan
problem (with characteristic denial) , his "founding" such a hedge
fund requires, by implication, that he agrees with Shiller about the
inefficiency of the market. The defender of the dogmas of modern
finance and efficient markets started a fund that took advantage of
market inefficiencies) It is as if the Pope converted to Islam.
  Things are not getting any better these days. At the time of
writing, news providers are offering all manner of updates, "break­
ing news" that can be delivered electronically in a wireless manner.
The ratio of undistilled information to distilled is rising, saturating
markets. The elder's messages need not be delivered to you as im­
minent news.
   This does not mean that all journalists are fooled by random­
ness noise providers : There are hordes of thoughtful journalists in
the business (I would suggest London's Anatole Kaletsky and New
York's Jim Grant and Alan Abelson as the underrated representa­
tives of such a class among financial journalists; Gary Stix among
scientific journalists) ; it is just that prominent media j ournalism is
a thoughtless process of providing the noise that can capture peo­
ple's attention and there exists no mechanism for separating the
       A M AT I-I E M AT I CA L M E D I TAT I O N O N I-I I S T O R Y   63


two.As a matter of fact, smart journalists are often penalized.Like
the lawyer in Chapter 1 1 who does not care about the truth, but
about arguments that can sway a jury whose intellectual defects
he knows intimately, journalism goes to what can capture our at­
tention, with adequate sound bites. Again, my scholarly friends
would wonder why I am getting emotional stating the obvious
things about the journalists; the problem with my profession is
that we depend on them for what information we need to obtain.

                               Gerontocracy
A preference for distilled thinking implies favoring old investors
and traders, that is, investors who have been exposed to markets
the longest, a matter that is counter to the common Wall Street
practice of preferring those that have been the most profitable, and
preferring the youngest whenever possible. I toyed with Monte
Carlo simulations of heterogeneous populations of traders under a
variety of regimes (closely resembling historical ones), and found a
significant advantage in selecting aged traders, using as a selection
criterion their cumulative years of experience rather than their ab­
solute success (conditional on their having survived without blow­
ing up) . "Survival of the fittest, " a term so hackneyed in the
investment media, does not seem to be properly understood:
Under regime switching, as we will see in Chapter 5 , it will be un­
clear who is actually the fittest, and those who will survive are not
necessarily those who appear to be the fittest. Curiously, it will be
the oldest, simply because older people have been exposed longer
to the rare event and can be, convincingly, more resistant to it.I was
amused to discover a similar evolutionary argument in mate selec­
tion that considers that women prefer (on balance) to mate with
healthy older men over healthy younger ones, everything else being
equal, as the former provide some evidence of better genes. Gray

the vagaries of life. Curiously, life insurers in renaissance Italy
reached the same conclusion, by charging the same insurance for a
man in his twenties as they did for a man in his fifties, a sign that
they had the same life expectancy; once a man crossed the forty­
year mark, he had shown that very few ailments could harm him.
We now proceed to a mathematical rephrasing of these arguments.

The wise man listens to meaning; the fool only gets the noise. The
modern Greek poet C. P. Cavafy wrote a piece in 1 9 1 5 after Philo­
stratus' adage "For the gods perceive things in the future, ordinary
people things in the present, but the wise perceive things about to
happen." Cavafy wrote :


   [n their intense meditation the hidden sound of things ap­
  proaching reaches them and they listen reverently while in the
   street outside the people hear nothing at all.


I thought hard and long on how to explain with as little mathe­
matics as possible the difference between noise and meaning, and
how to show why the time scale is important in judging a histori­
cal event. The Monte Carlo simulator can provide us with such an
intuition. We will start with an example borrowed from the in­
vestment world, as it can be explained rather easily, but the con­
cept can be used in any application.
   Let us manufacture a happily retired dentist, living in a pleas­
ant, sunny town . We know a priori that he is an excellent investor,
and that he will be expected to earn a return of 1 5 % in excess of
Treasury bills, with a 1 0% error rate per annum ( what we call
volatility) . It means that out of 1 00 sample paths, we expect close
        A M AT I-I E M AT I CA L M E D I TAT I O N O N I-I I S T O R Y   65


to 68 of them to fall within a band of plus and minus 10% around
the 15 % excess return, i.e., between 5 % and 2 5 % (to be technical;
the bell-shaped normal distribution has 68% of all observations
falling between -1 and 1 standard deviations) .It also means that
95 sample paths would fall between -5% and 3 5 % .
   Clearly, w e are dealing with a very optimistic situation. The
dentist builds for himself a nice trading desk in his attic, aiming to
spend every business day there watching the market, while sip­
ping decaffeinated cappuccino. He has an adventurous tempera­
ment, so he finds this activity more attractive than drilling the
teeth of reluctant little old Park Avenue ladies.
   He subscribes to a Web-based service that supplies him with
continuous prices, now to be obtained for a fraction of what he
pays for his coffee. He puts his inventory of securities in his
spreadsheet and can thus instantaneously monitor the value of his
speculative portfolio. We are living in the era of connectivity.
   A 15 % return with a 10% volatility (or uncertainty) per annum
translates into a 9 3 % probability of success in any given year. But
seen at a narrow time scale, this translates into a mere 50.02%
probability of success over any given second as shown in Table 3 .1.
Over the very narrow time increment, the observation will reveal


      Table 3 . 1 Probability of success at different scales

   Scale                                     Probability

close to nothing. Yet the dentist's heart will not tell him that.
Being emotional, he feels a pang with every loss, as it shows in red
on his screen. He feels some pleasure when the performance is
positive, but not in equivalent amount as the pain experienced
when the performance is negative.
    At the end of every day the dentist will be emotionally
drained. A minute-by-minute examination of his performance
means that each day (assuming eight hours per day) he will have
2 4 1 pleasurable minutes against 239 unpleasurable ones.These
amount to 60,688 and 60, 2 7 1, respectively, per year. Now real­
ize that if the unpleasurable minute is worse in reverse pleasure
than the pleasurable minute is in pleasure terms, then the dentist
incurs a large deficit when examining his performance at a high
frequency.
    Consider the situation where the dentist examines his portfolio
only upon receiving the monthly account from the brokerage
house.As 67% of his months will be positive, he incurs only four
pangs of pain per annum and eight uplifting experiences.This is
the same dentist following the same strategy. Now consider the
dentist looking at his performance only every year. Over the next
20 years that he is expected to live, he will experience 19 pleasant
surprises for every unpleasant one!
    This scaling property of randomness is generally misunder­
stood, even by professionals. I have seen Ph.D.s argue over a per­
formance observed in a narrow time scale (meaningless by any
standard) . Before additional dumping on the journalist, more ob­
servations seem in order.
    Viewing it from another angle, if we take the ratio of noise to
what we call nonnoise (i.e., left column/right column) , which we
have the privilege here of examining quantitatively, then we have
the following. Over one year we observe roughly 0.7 parts noise
for every one part performance. Over one month, we observe
roughly 2.32 parts noise for every one part performance.Over one
       A M AT I-I E M AT I CA L M E D I TAT I O N O N I-I I S T O R Y   67


hour, 30 parts noise for every one part performance, and over one
second, l , 796 parts noise for every one part performance.
  A few conclusions:

l . Over a short time increment, one observes the variability of
    the portfolio, not the returns. In other words, one sees the
  variance, little else.I always remind myself that what one ob­
  serves is at best a combination of variance and returns, not
   j ust returns (but my emotions do not care about what I tell
   myself).
2. Our emotions are not designed to understand the point.The
  dentist did better when he dealt with monthly statements
  rather than more frequent ones.Perhaps it would be even bet­
  ter for him if he limited himself to yearly statements. (If you
   think that you can control your emotions, think that some peo­
   ple also believe that they can control their heartbeat or hair
   growth.)
3 .When I see an investor monitoring his portfolio with live prices
   on his cellular telephone or his handheld, I smile and smile.


Finally, I reckon that I am not immune to such an emotional de­
fect.But I deal with it by having no access to information, except
in rare circumstances.Again, I prefer to read poetry. If an event is
important enough, it will find its way to my ears.I will return to
this point in time.
   The same methodology can explain why the news (the high
scale) is full of noise and why history (the low scale) is largely
stripped of it (though fraught with interpretation problems).This
explains why I prefer not to read the newspaper (outside of the
obituary), why I never chitchat about markets, and, when in a
trading room, I frequent the mathematicians and the secretaries,
not the traders. It explains why it is better to read The New Yorker
on Mondays than The Wall Street Journal every morning (from the
                     68   S O L O N ' S WAR N I N G


standpoint of frequency, aside from the massive gap in intellectual
class between the two publications) .
   Finally, this explains why people who look too closely at ran­
domness burn out, their emotions drained by the series of pangs
they experience.Regardless of what people claim, a negative pang
is not offset by a positive one (some psychologists estimate the
negative effect for an average loss to be up to 2.5 the magnitude of
a positive one); it will lead to an emotional deficit.
   Now that you know that the high-frequency dentist has more
exposure to both stress and positive pangs, and that these do not
cancel out, consider that people in lab coats have examined some
scary properties of this type of negative pangs on the neural sys­
tem (the usual expected effect: high blood pressure; the less ex­
pected: chronic stress leads to memory loss, lessening of brain
plasticity, and brain damage) .To my knowledge there are no stud­
ies investigating the exact properties of trader's burnout, but a
daily exposure to such high degrees of randomness without much
control will have physiological effects on humans (nobody studied
the effect of such exposure on the risk of cancer) . What econo­
mists did not understand for a long time about positive and nega­
tive kicks is that both their biology and their intensity are
different.Consider that they are mediated in different parts of the
brain-and that the degree of rationality in decisions made subse­
quent to a gain is extremely different from the one after a loss.
   Note also that the implication that wealth does not count so
much into one's well-being as the route one uses to get to it.
   Some so-called wise and rational persons often blame me for
"ignoring" possible valuable information in the daily newspaper
and refusing to discount the details of the noise as "short-term
events." Some of my employers have blamed me for living on a dif­
ferent planet.
   My problem is that I am not rational and I am extremely prone
to drown in randomness and to incur emotional tortur�. I am
       A M AT H E M AT I CA L M E D I TAT I O N O N H I S T O R Y   69


aware of my need to ruminate on park benches and in cafes away
from information, but I can only do so if I am somewhat deprived
of it. My sole advantage in life is that I know some of my weak­
nesses, mostly that I am incapable of taming my emotions facing
news and incapable of seeing a performance with a clear head. Si­
lence is far better. More on that in Part III.

           ur Monte Carlo engine can take us into more literary ter­
           ritory. Increasingly, a distinction is being made between
           the scientific intellectual and the literary intellectual-
culminating with what is called the "science wars," plotting fac­
tions of literate nonscientists against no less literate scientists.The
distinction between the two approaches originated in Vienna in
the 1930s, with a collection of physicists who decided that the
large gains in science were becoming significant enough to make
claims on the field known to belong to the humanities. In their
view, literary thinking could conceal plenty of well-sounding non-
RAN D O M NES S , N O N SEN SE, A N D T HE SCIEN T I F I C I N TEL LECT UAL   71


sense. They wanted to strip thinking from rhetoric ( except in lit­
erature and poetry where it properly belonged) .
   The way they introduced rigor into intellectual life is by de­
claring that a statement could fall only into two categories: deduc­
tive, like "2 + 2 = 4," i.e., incontrovertibly flowing from a precisely
defined axiomatic framework (here the rules of arithmetic), or in­
ductive, i.e., verifiable in some manner ( experience, statistics, etc.) ,
like "it rains i n Spain" o r "New Yorkers are generally rude." Any­
thing else was plain unadulterated hogwash (music could be a far
better replacement to metaphysics) . Needless to say that induc­
tive statements may turn out to be difficult, even impossible, to
verify, as we will see with the black swan problem-and empiri­
cism can be worse than any other form of hogwash when it gives
someone confidence (it will take me a few chapters to drill the
point) . However, it was a good start to make intellectuals respon­
sible for providing some form of evidence for their statements.
This Vienna Circle was at the origin of the development of the
ideas of Popper, Wittgenstein (in his later phase) , Carnap, and
flocks of others.Whatever merit their original ideas may have, the
impact on both philosophy and the practice of science has been
significant.Some of their impact on nonphilosophical intellectual
life is starting to develop, albeit considerably more slowly.
    One conceivable way to discriminate between a scientific intel­
lectual and a literary intellectual is by considering that a scientific
intellectual can usually recognize the writing of another but that
the literary intellectual would not be able to tell the difference be­
tween lines jotted down by a scientist and those by a glib nonsci­
entist. This is even more apparent when the literary intellectual
starts using scientific buzzwords, like "uncertainty principle, "
"Godel's theorem, " "parallel universe," or "relativity," either out of
context or, as often, in exact opposition to the scientific meaning.
I suggest reading the hilarious Fashionable Nonsense by Alan Sokal
for an illustration of such practice (I was laughing so loudly and so
                      72     S O L O N ' S WAR N I N G


frequently while reading it on a plane that other passengers kept
whispering things about me) . By dumping the kitchen sink of sci­
entific references in a paper, one can make another literary intel­
lectual believe that one's material has the stamp of science.
Clearly, to a scientist, science lies in the rigor of the inference, not
in random references to such grandiose concepts as general rela­
tivity or quantum indeterminacy. Such rigor can be spelled out in
plain English. Science is method and rigor; it can be identified in
the simplest of prose writing. For instance, what struck me while
reading Richard Dawkins' Selfish Gene is that, although the text
does not exhibit a single equation, it seems as if it were translated
from the language of mathematics.Yet it is artistic prose.

                           Reverse Tu ring Test
Randomness can be of considerable help with the matter. For
there is another, far more entertaining way to make the distinction
between the babbler and the thinker.You can sometimes replicate
something that can be mistaken for a literary discourse with a
Monte Carlo generator but it is not possible randomly to construct
a scientific one. Rhetoric can be constructed randomly, but not
genuine scientific knowledge.This is the application of Turing's test
of artificial intelligence, except in reverse.What is the Turing test?
The brilliant British mathematician, eccentric, and computer pio­
neer Alan Turing came up with the following test: A computer can
be said to be intelligent if it can (on average) fool a human into
mistaking it for another human. The converse should be true. A
human can be said to be unintelligent if we can replicate his
speech by a computer, which we know is unintelligent, and fool a
human into believing that it was written by a human. Can one
produce a piece of work that can be largely mistaken for Derrida
entirely randomly?
   The answer seems to be yes.Aside from the hoax by Alan Sokal
(the same of the hilarious book a few lines ago) , who managed to
RAN D O M NES S , N O N SEN SE, A N D Tl-IE SCIEN T I F I C I N TEL LECT UAL   73


produce nonsense and get it published by some prominent jour­
nal, there are Monte Carlo generators designed to structure such
texts and write entire papers. Fed with "postmodernist " texts, they
can randomize phrases under a method called recursive grammar,
and produce grammatically sound but entirely meaningless sen­
tences that sound like Jacques Derrida, Camille Paglia, and such a
crowd. Owing to the fuzziness of his thought, the literary intellec­
tual can be fooled by randomness.
   At the Monash University program in Australia featuring the
Dada Engine built by Andrew C. Bulhak, I toyed with the engine
and generated a few papers containing the following sentences:


  However, the main theme of the works of Rushdie is not theory,
  as the dialectic paradigm of reality suggests, but pretheory. The
  premise of the neosemanticist paradigm of discourse implies
  that sexual identity, ironically, has significance.
    Many narratives concerning the role of the writer as observer
  may be revealed . It could be said that if cultural narrative holds,
  we have to choose between the dialectic paradigm of narrative
  and neoconceptual Marxism . Sartre 's analysis of cultural narra­
  tive holds that society, paradoxically, has objective value.
     Thus, the premise of the neodialectic paradigm of expression
  implies that consciousness may be used to reinforce hierarchy,
  but only if reality is distinct from consciousness; if that is not
  the case, we can assume that language has intrinsic meaning.


Some business speeches belong to this category in their own right,
except that they are less elegant and draw on a different type of
vocabulary than the literary ones. We can randomly construct a
speech imitating that of your chief executive officer to ensure
whether what he is saying has value, or if it is merely dressed-up
nonsense from someone who was lucky to be put there.How? You
select randomly five phrases below, then connect them by adding
                        74   S O L O N ' S WA R N I N G


the minimum required to construct a grammatically sound
speech.


   We look after our customer's interests / the road ahead / our as­
   sets are our people / creation of shareholder value / our vision /
   our expertise lies in / we provide interactive solutions / we po­
   sition ourselves in this market / how to serve our customers bet­
   ter I short-term pain for long-term gain / we will be rewarded
   in the long run / we play from our strength and improve our
   weaknesses / courage and determination will prevail / we are
   committed to innovation and technology / a happy employee is
   a productive employee / commitment to excellence / strategic
   plan / our work ethics.


If this bears too close a resemblance to the speech you j ust
heard from the boss of your company, then I suggest looking for
a new j ob.

                  The Father ofAll Pseu dothinkers
It is hard to resist discussion of artificial history without a com­
ment on the father of all pseudothinkers, Hegel. Hegel writes a
j argon that is meaningless outside of a chic Left Bank Parisian cafe
or the humanities department of some u niversity extremely well
insulated from the real world. I suggest this passage from the Ger­
ma n "philosopher" (this passage was detected, translated, and re­
viled by Karl Popper) :


   S ound is the change in the specific condition of segregation of
   the material parts, and in the negation of this condition; merely
   an abstract or an ideal ideality, as it were, of that specification.
   But this change, accordingly, is itself immediately the negation of
   the material specific subsistence; which is, therefore, real ideality
   of specific gravity and cohesion, i.e.-heat. The heating up of
RA N D O M NES S , N O N SEN SE, AN D Tl-IE SCIEN T l l=IC I N TEL LECT UAL   75


   sounding bodies, just as of beaten and or rubbed ones, is the ap­
   pearance of heat, originating conceptually together with sound.


Even a Monte Carlo engine could not sound as random as the
great philosophical master thinker (it would take plenty of sample
runs to get the mixture of "heat " and "sound." People call that phi­
losophy and frequently finance it with taxpayer subsidies'. Now
consider that Hegelian thinking is generally linked to a "scientific "
approach to history; it has produced such results as Marxist
regimes and even a branch called "neo-Hegelian " thinking. These
"thinkers " should be given an undergraduate-level class on statisti­
cal sampling theory prior to their release into the open world.


                    MONTE CARLO POETRY

There are instances where I like to be fooled by randomness. My
allergy to nonsense and verbiage dissipates when it comes to art
and poetry. On the one hand, I try to define myself and behave of­
ficially as a no-nonsense hyperrealist ferreting out the role of
chance; on the other, I have no qualms indulging in all manner of
personal superstitions. Where do I draw the line? The answer is
aesthetics.Some aesthetic forms appeal to something in our biol­
ogy, whether or not they originate in random associations or plain
hallucination.Something in our human genes is deeply moved by
the fuzziness and ambiguity of language; then why fight it?
   The poetry and language lover in me was initially depressed by
the account of the "exquisite cadavers" poetic exercise, where in­
teresting and poetic sentences are ,-andomly constructed. By
throwing enough words together, some unusual and magical­
sounding metaphor is bound to emerge according to the laws of
combinatorics.Yet one cannot deny that some of these poems are
of ravishing beauty. Who cares about their origin if they manage to
please our aesthetic senses?
                      76   S O L O N ' S WA R N I N G


    The story of the "exquisite cadavers" is as follows.In the after­
math of the First World War, a collection of surrealist poets­
which included Andre Breton, their pope, Paul Eluard, and others­
got together in cafes and tried the following exercise (modern
literary critics attribute the exercise to the depressed mood after
the war and the need to escape reality) . On a folded piece of
paper, in turn, each one of them would write a predetermined
part of a sentence, not knowing the others' choice. The first
would pick an adjective, the second a noun, the third a verb, the
fourth an adjective, and the fifth a noun.The first publicized ex­
ercise of such random (and collective) arrangement produced
the following poetic sentence:

   The exquisite cadavers shall drink the new wine.
   (Les cadavres exquis boiront le vin nouveau.)

Impressive? It sounds even more poetic in the native French.
Quite impressive poetry has been produced in such a manner,
sometimes with the aid of a computer. But poetry has never been
truly taken seriously outside of the beauty of its associations,
whether they have been produced by the random ranting of one
or more disorganized brains, or the more elaborate constructions
of one conscious creator.
   Now, regardless of whether the poetry was obtained by a Monte
Carlo engine or sung by a blind man in Asia Minor, language is po­
tent in bringing pleasure and solace.Testing its intellectual validity
by translating it into simple logical arguments would rob it of a
varying degree of its potency, sometimes excessively; nothing can
be more bland than translated poetry. A convincing argument of
the role of language is the existence of surviving holy languages,
uncorrupted by the no-nonsense tests of daily use. Semitic reli­
gions, that is Judaism, Islam, and original Christianity understood
the point: Keep a language away from the rationalization of daily
RAN D O M N E S S , N O N S E N S E , A N D Tl-I E SCI E N T l l= IC I N T E L L E CTUAL   77


use and avoid the corruption of the vernacular. Four decades
ago, the Catholic church translated the services and liturgies from
Latin to the local vernaculars; one may wonder if this caused a
drop in religious beliefs. Suddenly religion subjected itself to
being judged by intellectual and scientific, without the aesthetic,
standards.The Greek Orthodox church made the lucky mistake,
upon translating some of its prayers from Church Greek into the
Semitic-based vernacular spoken by the Grecosyrians of the Anti­
och region (southern Turkey and northern Syria) , of choosing clas­
sical Arabic, an entirely dead language.My folks are thus lucky to
pray in a mixture of dead Koine (Church Greek) and no less dead
Koranic Arabic.
  What does this point have to do with a book on randomness?
Our human nature dictates a need for peche mignon. Even the
economists, who usually find completely abstruse ways to escape
reality, are starting to understand that what makes us tick is not
necessarily the calculating accountant in us.We do not need to be
rational and scientific when it comes to the details of our daily
life-only in those that can harm us and threaten our survival.
Modern life seems to invite us to do the exact opposite; become
extremely realistic and intellectual when it comes to such matters
as religion and personal behavior, yet as irrational as possible when
it comes to matters ruled by randomness (say, portfolio or real es­
tate investments) . I have encountered colleagues, "rational, " no­
nonsense people, who do not understand why I cherish the poetry
of Baudelaire and Saint-John Perse or obscure (and often impene­
trable) writers like Elias Canetti, J.L.Borges, or Walter Benjamin.
Yet they get sucked into listening to the "analyses" of a television
"guru," or into buying the stock of a company they know ab­
solutely nothing about, based on tips by neighbors who drive ex­
pensive cars.The Vienna Circle, in their dumping on Hegel-style
verbiage-based philosophy, explained that, from a scientific stand­
point, it was plain garbage, and, from an artistic point of view, it
                      78   S O L O N ' S WAR N I N G


was inferior to music. I have to say that I find Baudelaire far more
pleasant to frequent than CNN newscasters or listening to George
Will.
   There is a Y iddish saying: "If I am going to be forced to eat pork,
it better be of the best kind." If I am going to be fooled by ran­
domness, it better be of the beautiful (and harmless) kind. This
point will be made again in Part III.

requests, but tensed up; for him speaking English, in spite of his
fluency, seemed to require some expenditure of physical effort
that made him contract his head and neck muscles (some people
are not made to speak foreign languages) . What are emerging­
market bonds? "Emerging market" is the politically correct euphe-
                     80   S O L O N ' S WA R N I N G


mism to define a country that is not very developed (as a skeptic,
I do not impart to their "emergence" such linguistic certainty) .The
bonds are financial instruments issued by these foreign govern­
ments, mostly Russia, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, and Turkey.These
bonds traded for pennies when these governments were not doing
well. Suddenly investors rushed into these markets in the early
1990s and pushed the envelope further and further by acquiring
increasingly more exotic securities.All these countries were build­
ing hotels where United States cable news channels were avail­
able, with health clubs equipped with treadmills and large-screen
television sets that made them join the global village. They all had
access to the same gurus and financial entertainers. Bankers would
come to invest in their bonds and the countries would use the pro­
ceeds to build nicer hotels so more investors would visit.At some
point these bonds became the vogue and went from pennies to
dollars; those who knew the slightest thing about them accumu­
lated vast fortunes.
   Carlos supposedly comes from a patrician Latin-American
family that was heavily impoverished by the economic troubles of
the 1980s, but, again, I have rarely run into anyone from a ravaged
country whose family did not at some juncture own an entire
province or, say, supply the Russian czar with sets of dominoes.
After brilliant undergraduate studies, he went to Harvard to pur­
sue a Ph.D. in economics, as it was the sort of thing Latin­
American patricians had gotten into the habit of doing at the time
(with a view to saving their economies from the evils of non-Ph.D.
hands) . He was a good student but could not find a decent thesis
topic for his dissertation. Nor did he gain the respect of his thesis
advisor, who found him unimaginative. Carlos settled for a mas­
ter's degree and a Wall Street career.
   The nascent emerging-market desk of a New York bank hired
Carlos in 1992. He had the right ingredients for success; he knew
where on the map to find the countries that issued "Brady bonds,"
                S U RV I VA L 0 1= T l-I E LEA S T l= I T   81


dollar-denominated debt instruments issued by Less Developed
Countries. He knew what Gross Domestic Product meant. He
looked serious, brainy, and well-spoken, in spite of his heavy Span­
ish accent. He was the kind of person banks felt comfortable put­
ting in front of their customers.What a contrast with the other
traders who lacked polish]
   Carlos got there right in time to see things happening in that
market. When he joined the bank, the market for emerging­
market debt instruments was small and traders were located in un­
desirable parts of trading floors. But the activity rapidly became a
large, and growing, part of the bank's revenues.
   He was generic among this community of emerging market
traders; they are a collection of cosmopolitan patricians from
across the emerging-market world that remind me of the interna­
tional coffee hour at the Wharton School. I find it odd that rarely
does a person specialize in the market of his or her birthplace.
Mexicans based in London trade Russian securities, Iranians and
Greeks specialize in Brazilian bonds, and Argentines trade Turkish
securities.Unlike my experience with real traders, they are gener­
ally urbane, dress well, collect art, but are nonintellectual. T hey
seem too conformist to be true traders. T hey are mostly between
thirty and forty, owing to the youth of their market.You can ex­
pect many of them to hold season tickets to the Metropolitan
Opera.True traders, I believe, dress sloppily, are often ugly, and ex­
hibit the intellectual curiosity of someone who would be more in­
terested in the information-revealing contents of the garbage can
than the Cezanne painting on the wall.
    Carlos thrived as a trader-economist.He had a large network of
friends in the various Latin-American countries and knew exactly
what took place there. He bought bonds that he found attractive,
either because they paid him a good rate of interest, or because he
believed that they would become more in demand in the future,
therefore appreciating in price. It would be perhaps erroneous to
                      82   S O L O N ' S WA R N I N G


call him a trader. A trader buys and sells (he may sell what he does
not own and buy it back later, hopefully making a profit in a de­
cline; this is called "shorting ") .Carlos just bought-and he bought
in size.He believed that he was paid a good risk premium to hold
these bonds because there was economic value in lending to these
countries. Shorting, in his opinion, made no economic sense.
   Within the bank Carlos was the emerging-markets reference.
He could produce the latest economic figures at the drop of a hat.
He had frequent lunches with the chairman. In his opinion, trad­
ing was economics, little else.It had worked so well for him. He
got promotion after promotion, until he became the head trader
of the emerging-market desk at the institution. Starting in 1995,
Carlos did exponentially well in his new function, getting an ex­
pansion of his capital on a steady basis (i.e., the bank allocated a
larger portion of its funds to his operation)-so fast that he was in­
capable of using up the new risk limits.

                           The Good Years
The reason Carlos had good years was not just because he bought
emerging-market bonds and their value went up over the period.
It was mostly because he also bought dips. He accumulated when
prices experienced a momentary panic.The year 1997 would have
been bad had he not added to his position after the dip in October
that accompanied the false stock market crash that took place
then. Overcoming these small reversals of fortune made him feel
invincible. He could do no wrong.He believed that the economic
intuition he was endowed with allowed him to make good trading
decisions. After a market dip he would verify the fundamentals,
and, if they remained sound, he would buy more of the security
and lighten up as the market recovered. Looking back at the
emerging-market bonds between the time Carlos started his in­
volvement with these markets and his last bonus check in Decem­
ber 1997, one sees an upward sloping line, with occasional blips,
                S U RV I VA L 0 � T l-I !; L E; A S T � I T   83


such as the Mexican devaluation of 199 5 , followed by an ex­
tended rally. One can also see some occasional dips that turned
out to be "excellent buying opportunities."
  It was the summer of 1998 that undid Carlos-that last dip did
not translate into a rally. His track record up to that point included
just one bad quarter-but bad it was. He had earned for his bank
close to $80 million cumulatively in his previous years. He lost
$300 million in just one summer. What happened? When the mar­
ket started dipping in June, his friendly sources informed him that
the sell-off was merely the result of a "liquidation" by a New Jersey
hedge fund run by a former Wharton professor. That fund special­
ized in mortgage securities and had just received instructions to
wind down the overall inventory. The inventory included some
Russian bonds, mostly because yield hogs, as these funds are known,
engage in the activity of building a "diversified " portfolio of high­
yielding securities.

                            Averaging Down
When the market started falling, he accumulated more Russian
bonds, at an average of around $52.That was Carlos' trait, average
down.The problems, he deemed, had nothing to do with Russia,
and it was not some New Jersey fund run by some mad scientist
that was going to decide the fate of Russia."Read my lips: It's a li­
qui-da-tion1 " he yelled at those who questioned his buying.
   By the end of June, his trading revenues for 1998 had dropped
from up $60 million to up $20 million. That made him angry.But
he calculated that should the market rise back to the pre-New Jer­
sey sell-off, then he would be up $ 100 million.That was unavoid­
able, he asserted. These bonds, he said, would never, ever trade
below $48.He was risking so little, to possibly make so much.
  Then came July. The market dropped a bit more.The bench­
mark Russian bond was now at $ 4 3 . His positions were under­
water, but he increased his stakes. By now he was down $30
                     84    S O L O N ' S WA R N I N G


million for the year. His bosses were starting to become nervous,
but he kept telling them that, after all, Russia would not go under.
He repeated the cliche that it was too big to fail. He estimated
that bailing them out would cost so little and would benefit the
world economy so much that it did not make sense to liquidate his
inventory now. "This is the time to buy, not to sell," he said re­
peatedly. "These bonds are trading very close to their possible de­
fault value." In other words, should Russia go into default, and run
out of dollars to pay the interest on its debt, these bonds would
hardly budge. Where did he get this idea? From discussions
with other traders and emerging-market economists (or trader­
economist hybrids) . Carlos put about half his net worth, then $5
million, in the Russia Principal Bond. "I will retire on these prof­
its," he told the stockbroker who executed the trade.

                          L ines in the Sand
The market kept going through the lines in the sand. By early Au­
gust, they were trading in the thirties. By the middle of August,
they were in the twenties. And he was taking no action. He felt
that the price on the screen was quite irrelevant in his business of
buying "value."
   Signs of battle fatigue were starting to show in his behavior.
Carlos was getting jumpy and losing some of his composure. He
yelled at someone in a meeting: "Stop losses are for schmucks! I
am not going to buy high and sell low!" During his string of suc­
cesses he had learned to put down and berate traders of the non­
emerging-market variety. "Had we gotten out in October 1997
after our heavy loss we would not have had those excellent 1 997
results," he was also known to repeat. He also told management:
"These bonds trade at very depressed levels.Those who can invest
now in these markets would realize wonderful returns." Every
morning, Carlos spent an hour discussing the situation with mar­
ket economists around the globe. They all seemed to present a
similar story : This sell-off is overdone.
                 S U R V I VA L O F T l-I I: L l: A S T F I T   85


   Carlos' desk experienced losses in other emerging markets as
well. He also lost money in the domestic Russian Ruble Bond mar­
ket. His losses were mounting, but he kept telling his management
rumors about very large losses among other banks-larger than his.
He felt justified to show that "he fared well relative to the indus­
try." This is a symptom of systemic troubles; it shows that there was
an entire community of traders who were conducting the exact
same activity. Such statements, that other traders had also gotten
into trouble, are self-incriminating.A trader's mental construction
should direct him to do precisely what other people do not do.
   Toward the end of August, the bellwether Russia Principal
Bonds were trading below $ 10. Carlos' net worth was reduced by
almost half He was dismissed.So was his boss, the head of trading.
The president of the bank was demoted to a "newly created posi­
tion." Board members could not understand why the bank had so
much exposure to a government that was not paying its own em­
ployees-which, disturbingly, included armed soldiers. This was
one of the small points that emerging-market economists around
the globe, from talking to each other so much, forgot to take into
account.Veteran trader Marty O'Connell calls this the firehouse
effect. He had observed that firemen with much downtime who
talk to each other for too long come to agree on many things that
an outside, impartial observer would find ludicrous (they develop
political ideas that are very similar) . Psychologists give it a fancier
name, but my friend Marty has no training in behavioral sciences.
   The nerdy types at the International Monetary Fund had been
taken for a ride by the Russian government, which cheated on its
account. Let us remember that economists are evaluated on how
intelligent they sound, not on a scientific measure of their knowl­
edge of reality. However, the price of the bonds was not fooled. It
knew more than the economists, more than the Carloses of the
emerging-market departments.
  Louie, a veteran trader on the neighboring desk who suffered
much humiliation by these rich emerging-market traders, was
                         86    S O L O N ' S WAR N I N G


there, vindicated. Louie was then a fifty-two-year-old Brooklyn­
born-and-raised trader who over three decades survived every sin­
gle conceivable market cycle. He calmly looked at Carlos being
escorted by a security guard to the door like a captured soldier
taken to the arena. He muttered in his Brooklyn accent: "Econom­
ics Schmeconomics. It is all market dynamics."
    Carlos is now out of the market. T he possibility that history
may prove him right (at some point in the future) has nothing to
do with the fact that he is a bad trader. He has all of the traits of a
thoughtful gentleman, and would be an ideal son-in-law. But he
has most of the attributes of the bad trader.And, at any point in
time, the richest traders are often the worst traders.T his, I will
call the cross-sectional problem: At a given time in the market,
the most successful traders are likely to be those that are best
fit to the latest cycle.T his does not happen too often with den­
tists or pianists-because these professions are more immune to
randomness.

We met John, Nero's neighbor, in Chapter l .At the age of thirty­
five he had been on Wall Street as a corporate high-yield bonds
trader for seven years, since his graduation from Pace University's
Lubin School of Business.He rose to head up a team of ten traders
in record time-thanks to a jump between two similar Wall Street
firms that afforded him a generous profit-sharing contract. T he
contract allowed him to be paid 20% of his profits, as they stood
at the end of each calendar year. In addition, he was allowed to in­
vest his own personal money in his trades-a great privilege.
   John is not someone who can be termed as principally intelli­
gent, but he was believed to be endowed with a good measure of
business sense. He was said to be "pragmatic" and "professional."
He gave the impression that he was born a businessperson, never
                S U RV I VA L O F T l-I E L EA S T F I T   87


saying anything remotely unusual or out of place. He remained
calm in most circumstances, rarely betraying any form of emotion.
Even his occasional cursing (this is Wall Street] ) was so much in
context that it sounded, well, professional.
   John dressed impeccably. T his was in part due to his monthly
trips to London where his unit had a satellite supervising Euro­
pean high-yield activities. He wore a Savile Row tailored dark
business suit, with a Ferragamo tie-enough to convey the im­
pression that he was the epitome of the successful Wall Street pro­
fessional. Each time Nero ran into him he came away feeling
poorly dressed.
  John's desk engaged principally in an activity called "high-yield"
trading, which consisted in acquiring "cheap" bonds that yielded,
say, 10%, while the borrowing rate for his institution was 5 .5%. It
netted a 4.5 % revenue, also called interest rate differential-which
seemed small except that he could leverage himself and multiply
such profit by the leverage factor.He did this in various countries,
borrowing at the local rate and investing in "risky" assets. It was
easy for him to amass over $3 billion dollars in face value of such
trade across a variety of continents.He hedged the interest rate ex­
posure by selling U.S., U.K., French, and other government bond
futures, thus limiting his bet to the differential between the two
instruments.He felt protected by this hedging strategy-cocooned
(or so he thought) against those nasty fluctuations in the world's
global interest rates.

       The Quant Who K new Computers and Equations
John was assisted by Henry, a foreign quant whose English was in­
comprehensible, but who was believed to be at least equally com­
petent in risk-management methods. John knew no math; he
relied on Henry. "His brains and my business sense, " he was wont
to say.Henry supplied him with risk assessments concerning the
overall portfolio.Whenever John felt worried, he would ask Henry
                      88   S O L O N ' S WAR N I N G


for another freshly updated report. Henry was a graduate student
in Operations Research when John hired him. His specialty was a
field called Computational Finance, which1 as its name indicates,
seems to focus solely on running computer programs overnight.
Henry's income went from $50,000 to $600,000 in three years.
    Most of the profit John generated for the institution was not at­
tributable to the interest rate differential between the instruments
described above. It came from the changes in the value of the se­
curities John held, mostly because many other traders were ac­
quiring them to imitate John's trading strategy (thus causing the
price of these assets to rise) .The interest rate differential was get­
ting closer to what John believed was "fair value." John believed
that the methods he used to calculate "fair value" were sound. He
was backed by an entire department that helped him analyze and
determine which bonds were attractive and offered capital appre­
ciation potential. It was normal for him to be earning these large
profits over time.
    John made steady income for his employers, perhaps even bet­
ter than steady. Every year the revenues he generated almost dou­
bled as compared to the previous year. During his last year, his
income experienced a quantum leap as he saw the capital allo­
cated to his trades swell beyond his wildest expectations. His
bonus check was for $10 million (pretax, which would generate
close to a $ 5 million total tax bill). John's personal net worth
reached $1 million at the age of thirty-two. By the age of thirty­
five it had exceeded $16 million. Most of it came from the accu­
mulation of bonuses-but a sizeable share came from profits on
his personal portfolio.Of the $16 million, about $ 14 million he in­
sisted in keeping invested in his business. They allowed him,
thanks to the leverage (i.e., use of borrowed money) , to keep a
portfolio of $50 million involved in his trades, with $36 million
borrowed from the bank.The effect of the leverage is that a small
loss would be compounded and would wipe him out.
                S U RV I VA L O F T 1-1 E LE A S T F I T   89


   It took only a few days for the $ 14 million to turn into thin
air-and for John to lose his job at the same time. As with Carlos,
it all happened during the summer of 1998, with the meltdown of
high-yield bond values. Markets went into a volatile phase during
which nearly everything he had invested in went against him at
the same time. His hedges no longer worked out. He was mad at
Henry for not having figured out that these events could happen.
Perhaps there was a bug in the program.
   His reaction to the first losses was, characteristically, to ignore
the market."One would go crazy if one were to listen to the mood
swings of the market," he said.What he meant by that statement
was that the "noise" was mean reverting, and would likely be off­
set by "noise" in the opposite direction.That was the translation in
plain English of what Henry explained to him. But the "noise"
kept adding up in the same direction.
  As in a biblical cycle, it took seven years to make John a hero
and just seven days to make him a failure.John is now a pariah; he
is out of a job and his telephone calls are not returned. Many of his
friends were in the same situation.How? With all that information
available to him, his perfect track record (and therefore, in his
eyes, an above-average intelligence and skill-set), and the benefit of
sophisticated mathematics, how could he have failed? Is it perhaps
possible that he forgot about the shadowy figure of randomness?
      It took a long time for John to figure out what had happened,
owing to the rapidity with which the events unfolded and his
state of shellshock. The dip in the market was not very large. It
was just that his leverage was enormous. What was more shock­
ing for him was that all their calculations gave the event a proba­
bility of l in l , 000,000, 000, 000, 000,000,000, 000 years. Henry
called that a "ten sigma" event. The fact that Henry doubled
the odds did not seem to matter. It made the probability 2 in
 l , 000, 000 , 000 ,000, 000, 000, 000, 000 years.
      When will John recover from the ordeal? Probably never. The
                     90   S O L O N ' S WAR N I N G


reason is not because John lost money. Losing money is something
good traders are accustomed to. It is because he blew up; he lost
more than he planned to lose.His personal confidence was wiped
out. But there is another reason why John may never recover. T he
reason is that John was never skilled in the first place.He is one of
those people who happened to be there when it all happened. He
may have looked the part but there are plenty of people who look
the part.
    Following the incident, John regarded himself "ruined "; yet his
net worth is still close to $ 1 million, which could be the envy of
more than 99.9% of the inhabitants of our planet. Yet there is a
difference between a wealth level reached from above and a
wealth reached from below. The road from $16 million to $1 mil­
lion is not as pleasant as the one from O to $ 1 million.In addition,
John is full of shame; he still worries about running into old
friends on the street.
    His employer should perhaps be most unhappy with the over­
all outcome. John pulled some money out of the episode, the
$ 1 million he had saved. He should be thankful that the episode
did not cost him anything-except the emotional drain. His net
worth did not become negative. T hat was not the case for his last
employer.John had earned for the employers, New York invest­
ment banks, around $250 million in the course of the seven years.
He lost more than $600 million for his last employer in barely a
few days.

                     The Traits They Shared
The reader needs to be warned that not all of the emerging­
market and high-yield traders talk and behave like Carlos and
John. Only the most successful ones, alas, or perhaps those who
were the most successful during the 1992-1998 bull cycle.
   At their age, both John and Carlos still have the chance to make
a career.It would be wise for them to look outside of their current
                 5 U RV I VA L O F T H E LE A 5 T F I T   91


profession. The odds are that they will not survive the incident.
Why? Because by discussing the situation with each of them, one
can rapidly see that they share the traits of the acute successful ran­
domness fool who, in addition, operates in the most random of en­
vironments. What is more worrisome is that their bosses and
employers shared the same trait.They, too, are permanently out of
the market. We will see throughout this book what characterizes
the trait.Again, there may not be a clear definition for it, but you
can recognize it when you see it.No matter what John and Carlos
do, they will remain fools of randomness.


             A RE V I EW O F M ARKE T F OOLS
             O F RANDO M NESS C ONS TAN TS

Most of the traits partake of the same Table P. l right column-left
column confusion; how they are fooled by randomness. Below is a
brief outline of them:


    An overestimation of the accuracy of their beliefs in some
                                                           They
    measu re, either economic (Carlos) or statistical (John).
    never considered that the fact that trading on economic vari­
    ables has worked in the past may have been merely coinci­
    dental, or, perhaps even worse, that economic analysis was fit
    to past events to mask the random element in it. Consider
    that of all the possible economic theories available, one can
    find a plausible one that explains the past, or a portion of it.
    Carlos entered the market at a time when it worked, but he
    never tested for periods when markets did the opposite of
    sound economic analysis. There were periods when econom­
    ics failed traders, and others when it helped them.

    The U.S. dollar was overpriced (i.e., the foreign cu rrencies were
    und ervalu ed) in the early 1980s.     Traders who used their eco-
                   92   S O L O N ' S WAR N I N G


nomic intuitions and bought foreign currencies were wiped
out. But later those who did so got rich (members of the first
crop were bust) . It is random'. Likewise, those who shorted
Japanese stocks in the late 1980s suffered the same fate-few
survived to recoup their losses during the collapse of the
1990s.Toward the end of the last century there was a group of
operators called "macro" traders who dropped like flies, with,
for instance, "legendary" (rather, lucky) investor Julian Robert­
son closing shop in 2000 after having been a star until then.
Our discussion of survivorship bias will enlighten us further,
but, clearly, there is nothing less rigorous than their seemingly
rigorous use of economic analyses to trade.

A tendency to get married to positions. There is a saying that
bad traders divorce their spouse sooner than abandon their
positions. Loyalty to ideas is not a good thing for traders, sci­
entists-or anyone.

The tendency to cha nge their story.  They become investors
"for the long haul" when they are losing money, switching
back and forth between traders and investors to fit recent re­
versals of fortune.The difference between a trader and an in­
vestor lies in the duration of the bet, and the corresponding
size.There is absolutely nothing wrong with investing "for the
long haul," provided one does not mix it with short-term trad­
ing-it is just that many people become long-term investors
after they lose money, postponing their decision to sell as part
of their denial.

No precise game plan ahead of time as to what to do in the
event of losses. They simply were not aware of such a possi­
bility. Both bought more bonds after the market declined
sharply, but not in response to a predetermined plan.
                  S U R V I VA L O F T l-I E L EA S T F I T   93


    Absence of critical thinking expressed in absence of revision of
    their stance with "stop losses."        Middlebrow traders do not like
    selling when it is "even better value." They did not consider
    that perhaps their method of determining value is wrong,
    rather than the market failing to accommodate their measure
    of value.They may be right, but, perhaps, some allowance for
    the possibility of their methods being flawed was not made.
    For all his flaws, we will see that Soros seems rarely to exam­
    ine an unfavorable outcome without testing his own frame­

    Denial.    When the losses occurred there was no clear accept­
    ance of what had happened. The price on the screen lost its
    reality in favor of some abstract "value." In classic denial mode,
    the usual "this is only the result of liquidation, distress sales "
    was proffered. They continuously ignored the message from
    reality.

How could traders who made every single mistake in the book be­
come so successful? Because of a simple principle concerning ran­
domness. This is one manifestation of the survivorship bias. We
tend to think that traders were successful because they are good.
Perhaps we have turned the causality on its head; we consider
them good just because they make money. One can make money
in the financial markets totally out of randomness.
    Both Carlos and John belong to the class of people who bene­
fited from a market cycle.It was not merely because they were in­
volved in the right markets. It was because they had a bent in their
style that closely fitted the properties of the rallies experienced in
their market during the episode.They were dip buyers. That hap­
pened, in hindsight, to be the trait that was the most desirable be­
tween 1992 and the summer of 1998 in the specific markets in
which the two men specialized. Most of those who happened to
                      94   S O L O N ' S WA R N I N G


have that specific trait, over the course of that segment of history,
dominated the market. Their score was higher and they replaced
people who, perhaps, were better traders.

The stories of Carlos and John illustrate how bad traders have a
short- and medium-term survival advantage over good traders.
Next we take the argument to a higher level of generality. One
must be either blind or foolish to reject the theories of Darwinian
self-selection. However, the simplicity of the concept has drawn
segments of amateurs (as well as a few professional scientists) into
blindly believing in continuous and infallible Darwinism in all
fields, which includes economics.
    The biologist Jacques Monod bemoaned a couple of decades
ago that everyone believes himself an expert on evolution (the
same can be said about the financial markets); things have gotten
worse. Many amateurs believe that plants and animals reproduce
on a one-way route toward perfection.Translating the idea in so­
cial terms, they believe that companies and organizations are,
thanks to competition (and the discipline of the quarterly report) ,
irreversibly heading toward betterment. The strongest will sur­
vive; the weakest will become extinct.As to investors and traders,
they believe that by letting them compete, the best will prosper
and the worst will go learn a new craft (like pumping gas or, some­
times, dentistry) .
    Things are not as simple as that.We will ignore the basic mis­
use of Darwinian ideas in the fact that organizations do not repro­
duce like living members of nature-Darwinian ideas are about
reproductive fitness, not about survival. The problem comes, as
everything else in this book, from randomness. Zoologists found
that once randomness is injected into a system, the results can be
quite surprising: What seems to be an evolution may be merely a
diversion, and possibly regression. For instance, Steven Jay Gould
                S U RV I VA L O F T l-I E L EA S T F I T   95


(who was accused of being more of a popularizer than a genuine
scientist) found ample evidence of what he calls "genetic noise," or
"negative mutations," thus incurring the wrath of some of his col­
leagues (he took the idea a little too far) .An academic debate en­
sued, plotting Gould against colleagues like Dawkins who were
considered by their peers as better trained in the mathematics of
randomness.Negative mutations are traits that survive in spite of
being worse, from the reproductive fitness standpoint, than the
ones they replaced. However, they cannot be expected to last
more than a few generations (under what is called temporal ag­
gregation).
   Furthermore, things can get even more surprising when ran­
domness changes in shape, as with regime switches. A regime
switch corresponds to situations when all of the attributes of a sys­
tem change to the point of its becoming unrecognizable to the ob­
server.Darwinian fitness applies to species developing over a very
long time, not observed over a short term-time aggregation elim­
inates much of the effects of randomness; things (I read noise) bal­
ance out over the long run, as people say.
   Owing to the abrupt rare events, we do not live in a world
where things "converge " continuously toward betterment.Nor do
things in life move continuously at all.The belief in continuity was
ingrained in our scientific culture until the early twentieth cen­
tury.It was said that nature does not make jumps; people quote this
in well-sounding Latin: Natura non facit saltus. It is generally at­
tributed to the eighteenth-century botanist Linnaeus who obvi­
ously got it all wrong.It was also used by Leibniz as a justification
for calculus, as he believed that things are continuous no matter
the resolution at which we look at them.Like many well-sounding
"make sense" types of statements (such dynamics made perfect in­
tellectual sense) , it turned out to be entirely wrong, as it was de­
nied by quantum mechanics. We discovered that, in the very
small, particles jump (discretely) between states; they do not slide
between them.

           Can Evolution Be Fooled by Randomness?
We end this chapter with the following thought.Recall that some­
one with only casual knowledge about the problems of random­
ness would believe that an animal is at the maximum fitness for
the conditions of its time.T his is not what evolution means; on av­
erage, animals will be fit, but not every single one of them, and not
at all times.Just as an animal could have survived because its sam­
ple path was lucky, the "best" operators in a given business can
come from a subset of operators who survived because of overfit­
ness to a sample path-a sample path that was free of the evolu­
tionary rare event. One vicious attribute is that the longer these
animals can go without encountering the rare event, the more vul­
nerable they will be to it.We said that should one extend time to
infinity, then, by ergodicity, that event will happen with certainty­
the species will be wiped out] For evolution means fitness to one
and only one time series, not the average of all the possible envi­
ronments.
    By some viciousness of the structure of randomness, a prof­
itable person like John, someone who is a pure loser in the long
run and correspondingly unfit for survival, presents a high degree
of eligibility in the short run and has the propensity to multiply
his genes. Recall the hormonal effect on posture and its signaling
effect to other potential mates. His success (or pseudosuccess
owing to its fragility) will show in his features as a beacon.An in­
nocent potential mate will be fooled into thinking (uncondition­
ally) that he has a superior genetic makeup, until the following
rare event.Solon seems to have gotten the point; but try to explain
the problem to a naive business Darwinist-or your rich neighbor
across the street.

    We introduce the concept of skewness: Why the tenns "bull"
    and "bear" have limited meaning outside of zoology. A vi­
    cious child wrecks the structure of randomness. An introduc­
    tion to the problem of epistemic opacity. The penultimate step

      he essayist and scientist Steven Jay Gould (who, for a while,
      was my role model) , was once diagnosed when he was in his
     forties with a deadly form of cancer of the lining of the
stomach.The first piece of information he received about his odds
of making it was that the median survival for the ailment is ap­
proximately eight months; information he felt akin to Isaiah's in­
junction to King Hezekiah to put his house in order in preparation
for death.
   Now, a medical diagnosis, particularly one of such severity, can
motivate people to do intensive research, particularly those pro-
                      98   S O L O N ' S WAR N I N G


lific writers like Gould who needed more time with us to com­
plete a few book projects. The further research by Gould uncov­
ered a very different story from the information he had initially
been given; mainly that the expected (i.e., average) survival was
considerably higher than eight months.It came to his notice that
expected and median do not mean the same thing at all. Median
means roughly that 50% of the people die before eight months
and 50% survive longer than eight months.But those who survive
would live considerably longer, generally going about life just like
a regular person and fulfilling the average 7 3 .4 or so years pre­
dicted by insurance mortality tables.
    There is asymmetry. Those who die do so very early in the
game, while those who live go on living very long.Whenever there
is asymmetry in outcomes, the average survival has nothing to do
with the median survival.This prompted Gould, who thus under­
stood the hard way the concept of skewness, to write his heartfelt
piece "The Median Is Not the Message." His point is that the con­
cept of median used in medical research does not characterize a
probability distribution.
    I will simplify Gould's point by introducing the concept of
mean (also called average or expectation) as follows, by using a less
morbid example, that of gambling. I will give an example of both
asymmetric odds and asymmetric outcomes to explain the point.
Asymmetric odds means that probabilities are not 50% for each
event, but that the probability on one side is higher than the prob­
ability on the other.Asymmetric outcomes mean that the payoffs
are not equal.
    Assume I engage in a gambling strategy that has 999 chances in
1, 000 of making $ 1 (event A) and 1 chance in 1, 000 of losing
$ 10, 000 (event B) , as in Table 6.1.My expectation is a loss of close
to $9 (obtained by multiplying the probabilities by the correspon­
ding outcomes) .The frequency or probability of the loss, in and by
itself, is totally irrelevant; it needs to be judged in connection with
                S K EW NES S A N D A S Y M M ET R Y     99


                              Table 6.1

the magnitude of the outcome. Here A is far more likely than B.
Odds are that we would make money by betting for event A, but it
is not a good idea to do so.
  T his point is rather common and simple; it is understood by
anyone making a simple bet. Yet I had to struggle all my life with
people in the financial markets who do not seem to internalize it.I
am not talking of novices; I am talking of people with advanced de­
grees (albeit MBAs) who cannot come to grips with the difference.
   How could people miss such a point? Why do they confuse
probability and expectation, that is, probability and probability
times the payoff? Mainly because much of people's schooling
comes from examples in symmetric environments, like a coin toss,
where such a difference does not matter. In fact, the so-called bell
curve that seems to have found universal use in society is entirely
symmetric. More on that later.


               B ULL AND B � AR Z OOLOGY

T he general press floods us with concepts like bullish and bearish
which refer to the effect of higher (bullish) or lower (bearish)
prices in the financial markets. But also we hear people saying "I
am bullish on Johnny" or "I am bearish on that guy Nassim in the
back who seems incomprehensible to me," to denote the belief in
the likelihood of someone's rise in life.I have to say that bullish or
bearish are often hollow words with no application in a world of
                     100   S O L O N ' S WAR N I N G


randomness-particularly if such a world, like ours, presents
asymmetric outcomes.
   When I was in the employment of the New York office of a
large investment house, I was subjected on occasions to the harry­
ing weekly "discussion meeting, " which gathered most profession­
als of the New York trading room. I do not conceal that I was not
fond of such gatherings, and not only because they cut into my
gym time. While the meetings included traders, that is, people
who are judged on their numerical performance, it was mostly a
forum for salespeople (people capable of charming customers) ,
and the category of entertainers called Wall Street "economists " or
"strategists, " who make pronouncements on the fate of the mar­
kets, but do not engage in any form of risk taking, thus having their
success dependent on rhetoric rather than actually testable facts.
During the discussion, people were supposed to present their
opinions on the state of the world. To me, the meeting was pure
intellectual pollution. Everyone had a story, a theory, and insights
that they wanted others to share.I resent the person who, without
having done much homework in libraries, thinks that he is onto
something rather original and insightful on a given subject matter
(and I respect people with scientific minds, like my friend Stan
Jonas, who feel compelled to spend their nights reading wholesale
on a subject matter, trying to figure out what was done on the sub­
ject by others before emitting an opinion-would the reader listen
to the opinion of a doctor who does not read medical papers?) .
    I have to confess that my optimal strategy (to soothe my bore­
dom and allergy to confident platitudes) was to speak as much as
I could, while totally avoiding listening to other people's replies by
trying to solve equations in my head. Speaking too much would
help me clarify my mind, and, with a little bit of luck, I would not
be "invited " back (that is, forced to attend) the following week.
    I was once asked in one of those meetings to express my views
on the stock market. I stated, not without a modicum of pomp,
                S K EW N E S S A N D A S Y M M E T R Y   1 01


that I believed that the market would go slightly up over the next
week with a high probability. How high? "About 70%." Clearly,
that was a very strong opinion.But then someone interj ected, "But,
Nassim, you j ust boasted being short a very large quantity of
SPS00 futures, making a bet that the market would go down.What
made you change your mind? " "I did not change my mind1 I have a
lot of faith in my bet1 [Audience laughing.] As a matter of fact I
now feel like selling even more1" The other employees in the room
seemed utterly confused. ''Are you bullish or are you bearish?" I
was asked by the strategist. I replied that I could not understand
the words bullish and bearish outside of their purely zoological
consideration.Just as with events A and B in the preceding exam­
ple, my opinion was that the market was more likely to go up ("I
would be bullish ") , but that it was preferable to short it ("I would
be bearish "), because, in the event of its going down, it could go
down a lot. Suddenly, the few traders in the room understood my
opinion and started voicing similar opinions.And I was not forced
to come back to the following discussion.
   Let us assume that the reader shared my opinion, that the mar­
ket over the next week had a 70% probability of going up and 30%
probability of going down.However, let us say that it would go up
by 1% on average, while it could go down by an average of 10%.
What would the reader do? Is the reader bullish or bearish ?

   Accordingly, bullish or bearish are terms used by people who do
not engage in practicing uncertainty, like the television commen­
tators, or those who have no experience in handling risk.Alas, in­
vestors and businesses are not paid in probabilities; they are paid
in dollars.Accordingly, it is not how likely an event is to happen
that matters, it is how much is made when it happens that should
be the consideration. How frequent the profit is irrelevant; it is the
magnitude of the outcome that counts.It is a pure accounting fact
that, aside from the commentators, very few people take home a
check linked to how often they are right or wrong.What they get
is a profit or loss.As to the commentators, their success is linked to
how often they are right or wrong. This category includes the
"chief strategists" of major investment banks the public can see on
TV, who are nothing better than entertainers. They are famous,
seem reasoned in their speech, plow you with numbers, but, func­
tionally, they are there to entertain-for their predictions to have
any validity they would need a statistical testing framework.Their
frame is not the result of some elaborate test but rather the result
of their presentation skills.

             An Arrogant Twenty-n ine-year-old Son
Outside of the need for entertainment in these shallow meetings I
have resisted voicing a "market call" as a trader, which caused some
personal strain with some of my friends and relatives. One day a
friend of my father-of the rich and confident variety-called me
during his New York visit (to set the elements of pecking order
straight, he hinted right away during the call that he came by Con­
corde, with some derogatory comment on the comfort of such
method of transportation) . He wanted to pick my brain on the
state of a collection of financial markets. I truly had no opinion,
nor had made the effort to formulate any, nor was I remotely in­
terested in markets. The gentleman kept plowing me with ques­
tions on the state of economies, on the European central banks;
                S K EW N E S S A N D A S Y M M ETRY   1 03


these were precise questions no doubt aiming to compare my
opinion to that of some other "expert" handling his account at one
of the large New York investment firms. I neither concealed that I
had no clue, nor did I seem sorry about it. I was not interested in
markets ("yes, I am a trader") and did not make predictions, pe­
riod. I went on to explain to him some of my ideas on the struc­
ture of randomness and the verifiability of market calls but he
wanted a more precise statement of what the European bond mar­
kets would do by the Christmas season.
    He came away under the impression that I was pulling his leg;
it almost damaged the relationship between my father and his rich
and confident friend. For the gentleman called him with the fol­
lowing grievance : "When I ask a lawyer a legal question , he an­
swers me with courtesy and precision. When I ask a doctor a
medical question , he gives me his opinion. No specialist ever gives
me disrespect. Your insolent and conceited twenty-nine-year-old
son is playing prima donna and refuses to answer me about the di­
rection of the market!"

                             Rare Events
The best description of my lifelong business in the market is
"skewed bets," that is, I try to benefit from rare events, events that
do not tend to repeat themselves frequently, but, accordingly,
present a large payoff when they occur. I try to make money in­
frequently, as infrequently as possible, simply because I believe
that rare events are not fairly valued, and that the rarer the event,
the more undervalued it will be in price. In addition to my own
empiricism, I think that the counterintuitive aspect of the trade
(and the fact that our emotional wiring does not accommodate it)
gives me some form of advantage.
   Why are these events poorly valued? Because of a psychologi­
cal bias; people who surrounded me in my career were too fo­
cused on memorizing section 2 of The Wall Street Journal during
                     104   S O L O N ' S WAR N I N G


their train ride to reflect properly on the attributes of random
events.Or perhaps they watched too many gurus on television.Or
perhaps they spent too much time upgrading their PalmPilot.
Even some experienced trading veterans do not seem to get the
point that frequencies do not matter.Jim Rogers, a "legendary " in­
vestor, made the following statement:

  I don't buy options.Buying options is another way to go to the
  poorhouse. Someone did a study for the SEC and discovered
  that 90 percent of all options expire as losses.Well, I figured out
  that if 90 percent of all long option positions lost money, that
  meant that 90 percent of all short option positions make
  money. If I want to use options to be bearish, I sell calls.

Visibly, the statistic that 90% of all option positions lost money is
meaningless, (i.e., the frequency) if we do not take into account
how much money is made on average during the remaining 10%.If
we make 50 times our bet on average when the option is in the
money, then I can safely make the statement that buying options
is another way to go to the palazzo rather than the poorhouse. Mr.
Jim Rogers seems to have gone very far in life for someone who
does not distinguish between probability and expectation
(strangely, he was the partner of George Soros, a complex man
who thrived on rare events-more on him later) .
    One such rare event is the stock market crash of 1987, which
made me as a trader and allowed me the luxury of becoming in­
volved in all manner of scholarship.Nero of the smaller house in
Chapter 1 aims to get out of harm's way by avoiding exposure to
rare events-a mostly defensive approach. I am far more aggres ­
sive than Nero and go one step further; I have organized my career
and business in such a way as to be able to benefit from th em.In
other words, I aim at profiting from the rare event, with my asym­
metric bets.

                         Symmetry and Science
In most disciplines, such asymmetry does not matter. In an aca­
demic pass/fail environment, where the cumulative grade does
not matter, only frequency matters. Outside of that it is the mag­
nitude that counts. Unfortunately, the techniques used in eco­
nomics are often imported from other areas-financial economics
is still a young discipline (it is certainly not yet a "science ") .People
in most fields outside of it do not have problems eliminating ex­
treme values from their sample, when the difference in payoff be­
tween different outcomes is not significant, which is generally the
case in education and medicine.A professor who computes the av­
erage of his students' grades removes the highest and lowest ob­
servations, which he would call outliers, and takes the average of
the remaining ones, without this being an unsound practice.A ca­
sual weather forecaster does the same with extreme tempera­
tures-an unusual occurrence might be deemed to skew the
overall result (though we will see that this may turn out to be a
mistake when it comes to forecasting future properties of the ice
cap) . So people in finance borrow the technique and ignore infre­
quent events, not noticing that the effect of a rare event can bank­
rupt a company.
   Many scientists in the physical world are also subject to such
foolishness, misreading statistics. One flagrant example is in the
global-warming debate. Many scientists failed to notice it in its
early stages as they removed from their sample the spikes in tem­
perature, under the belief that these were not likely to recur. It
may be a good idea to take out the extremes when computing the
average temperatures for vacation scheduling. But it does not
work when we study the physical properties of the weather-par­
ticularly when one cares about a cumulative effect. These scien­
tists initially ignored the fact that these spikes, although rare, had
the effect of adding disproportionately to the cumulative melting
                      106   S O L O N ' S WAR N I N G


of the ice cap.Just as in finance, an event, although rare, that brings
large consequences cannot just be ignored.

Jim Rogers is not the only person committing such traditional fal­
lacy of mistaking mean and median. In all fairness to him, some
people who think for a living, such as the star philosopher Robert
Nozik, have committed versions of the same mistake (Nozik, be­
sides, was an admirable and incisive thinker; before his premature
death he was perhaps the most respected American philosopher
of his generation) .In his book The Nature of Rationality he gets, as
is typical with philosophers, into amateur evolutionary arguments
and writes the following: "Since not more than 50 percent of the
individuals can be wealthier than average." Of course, more than
50% of individuals can be wealthier than average. Consider that
you have a very small number of very poor people and the rest
clustering around the middle class. The mean will be lower than
the median.Take a population of I O people, 9 having a net worth
of $30,000 and l having a net worth of $ 1 ,000. The average net
worth is $2 7 , 1 00 and 9 out of 1 0 people will have above average
wealth.
    Figure 6.1 shows a series of points starting with an initial level
W 0 and ending at the period concerned Wt .It can also be seen as
the performance, hypothetical or realized, of your favorite trading
strategy, the track record of an investment manager, the price of a
foot of average Palazzo real estate in Renaissance Florence, the
price series of the Mongolian stock market, or the difference be­
tween the U.S. and Mongolian stock markets.It is composed of a
given number of sequential observations W 1 , W2, etc., ordered in
such a way that the one to the right comes after the one to the left.

stripped of randomness (the right-column world in Table P.l on
page xliii) , and we knew with certainty that it was the case, things

would be rather easy. The pattern of the series would reveal con­
siderable and predictive information. You could tell with precision
what would happen one day ahead, one year ahead, and perhaps
even a decade ahead. We would not even need a statistician; a sec­
ond-rate engineer would do. He does not even need to be armed
with a modern degree; someone with nineteenth-century training
under Laplace would be able to solve the equations, called differ­
ential equations, or, equivalently, equations of motion-since we are
studying the dynamics of an entity whose position depends on
time.
   If we were dealing with a world where randomness is charted,
things would be easy as well, given that there is an entire field cre­
ated for that called Econometrics or Time Series Analysis. You would
call a friendly econometrician (my experience of econometricians
is that they are usually polite and friendly to practitioners) . He
would run the data in his software, and provide you with diagnos­
tics that would tell you if it is worth investing in the trader gener­
ating such a track record, or if it is worth pursuing the given trading
strategy. You can even buy the student version of his software for
under $999 and run it yourself during the next rainy weekend.
    But we are not sure that the world we live in is well charted.
We will see that the judgment derived from the analysis of these
                     108   S O L O N ' S WAR N I N G


past attributes may on occasion be relevant. But it may be mean­
ingless; it could on occasion mislead you and take you in the op­
posite direction.Sometimes market data becomes a simple trap; it
shows you the opposite of its nature, simply to get you to invest in
the security or mismanage your risks. Currencies that exhibit the
largest historical stability, for example, are the most prone to
crashes.This was bitterly discovered in the summer of 1997 by in­
vestors who chose the safety of the pegged currencies of Malaysia,
Indonesia, and Thailand (they were pegged to the U.S. dollar in a
manner to exhibit no volatility, until their sharp, sudden, and bru­
tal devaluations) .
    We could be either too lax or too stringent in accepting past in­
formation as a prediction of the future.As a skeptic, I reject a sole
time series of the past as an indication of future performance; I
need a lot more than data. My major reason is the ra re event, but I
have plenty of others.
    On the surface, my statement here may seem to contradict ear­
lier discussions, where I blame people for not learning enough
from history. The problem is that we read too much into shallow
recent history, with statements like "this has never happened be­
fore, " but not from history in general (things that never happened
before in one area tend eventually to happen) .In other words, his­
tory teaches us that things that never happened before do happen.
It can teach us a lot outside of the narrowly defined time series;
the broader the look, the better the lesson.In other words, history
teaches us to avoid the brand of naive empiricism that consists of
learning from casual historical facts.


               THE RARE-EVENT FALLACY

                  The Mother of All Deceptions
The rare event, owing to its dissimulative nature, can take a vari­
ety of shapes.It is in Mexico that it was spotted first, where it was
                S K EW N E S S A N D A S Y M M E T R Y   1 09


called by academics the peso problem. Econometricians were puz­
zled by the behavior of the Mexican economic variables during
the 1980s.The money supply, interest rates, or some similar meas­
ure of small relevance to the story exhibited some moody behav­
ior, thwarting many of their efforts at modeling them. These
indicators erratically switched between periods of stability and
brief bursts of turbulence without warning.
  By generalization, I started to label a rare event as any behavior
where the adage "beware of calm waters " can hold. Popular wis­
dom often warns of the old neighbor who appears to remain
courtly and reserved, the model of an excellent citizen, until you
see his picture in the national paper as a deranged killer who went
on a rampage. Until then, he was not known to have committed
any transgression.There was no way to predict that such patho­
logical behavior could emanate from such a nice person.I associ­
ate rare events with any misunderstanding of the risks derived
from a narrow interpretation of past time series.
   Rare events are always unexpected, otherwise they would not
occur. The typical case is as follows. You invest in a hedge fund
that enjoys stable returns and no volatility, until one day, you re­
ceive a letter starting with "An unforeseen and unexpected event,
deemed a rare occurrence . . . " (emphasis mine).But rare events
exist precisely because they are unexpected. They are generally
caused by panics, themselves the results of liquidations (investors
rushing to the door simultaneously by dumping anything they can
put their hands on as fast as possible). If the fund manager or
trader expected it, he and his like-minded peers would not have
invested in it, and the rare event would not have taken place.
   The rare event is not limited.- to one security.It can readily af­
fect the performance of a portfolio.For example, many traders en­
gage in the purchase of mortgage securities and hedge them in
some manner to offset the risks and eliminate the volatility, hop­
ing to derive some profits in excess of the Treasury bond returns
                      110   S O L O N ' S WAR N I N G


( which is used as the benchmark of the minimum expected re­
turns on an investment) . They use computer programs and draw
meaningful assistance from Ph.D.s in applied mathematics, astro­
physics, particle physics, electrical engineering, fluid dynamics, or
sometimes (though rarely) plain Ph.D.s in finance. Such a portfo­
lio shows stable returns for long periods. Then, suddenly, as if by
accident (I consider that no accident) , the portfolio drops by 40%
of its value when you expect, at the worst, a 4% drop.You call the
manager to express your anger and he tells you that it was not his
fault, but somehow the relationship dramatically changed (liter­
ally) . He will also point out to you that similar funds also experi­
enced the same problems.
    Recall that some economists call the rare event a "peso prob­
lem." The designation peso problem does not appear to be unde­
servedly stereotypical. Things have not gotten better since the
early 1980s with the currency of the United States' southern
neighbor. Long periods of stability draw hordes of bank currency
traders and hedge fund operators to the calm waters of the Mexi­
can peso; they enjoy owning the currency because of the high in­
terest rate it commands.Then they "unexpectedly " blow up, lose
money for investors, lose their jobs, and switch careers. Then a
new period of stability sets in.New currency traders come in with
no memory of the bad event.They are drawn to the Mexican peso,
and the story repeats itself.
    It is an oddity that most fixed-income financial instruments
present rare events.In the spring of 1998, I spent two hours ex­
plaining to a then-important hedge fund operator the notion of
the peso problem. I went to great lengths to explain to him that
the concept was generalized to every form of investment that was
based on a naive interpretation of the volatility of past time series.
 The reply was: "You are perfectly right.We do not touch the Mex­
ican peso.We only invest in the Russian ruble." He blew up a few
 months later.Until then, the Russian ruble carried attractive inter-
                 S K E W N E S S A N D A S Y M M E TRY   lll


est rates, which invited yield hogs of all types to get involved. He
and other holders of investments denominated in rubles lost close
to 9 7 % of their investment during the summer of 1 998.
  We saw in Chapter 3 that the dentist does not like volatility as
it causes a high incidence of negative pangs.The closer he observes
his performance, the more pain he will experience owing to the
greater variability at a higher resolution. Accordingly investors,
merely for emotional reasons, will be drawn into strategies that ex­
perience rare but large variations. It is called pushing randomness
under the rug. Psychologists recently found out that people tend
to be sensitive to the presence or absence of a given stimulus
rather than its magnitude.This implies that a loss is first perceived
as just a loss, with further implications later.The same with prof­
its.The agent would prefer the number of losses to be low and the
number of gains to be high, rather than optimizing the total per­
formance.
   We can look at other aspects of the problem; think of someone
involved in scientific research. Day after day, he will engage in dis­
secting mice in his laboratory, away from the rest of the world. He
could try and try for years and years without anything to show for
it. His significant other might lose patience with the loser who
comes home every night smelling of mice urine. Until bingo, one
day he comes up with a result.Someone observing the time series
of his occupation would see absolutely no gain, while every day
would bring him closer in probability to the end result.
   The same with publishers; they can publish dog after dog
without their business model being the least questionable, if
once every decade they hit on a Harry Potter string of super­
bestsellers-provided of course that they publish quality work
that has a small probability of being of very high appeal. An in­
teresting economist, Art De Vany, manages to apply these ideas to
two fields: the movie business and his own health and lifestyle.
He figured out the skewed properties of the movies payoffs and
                      112   S O L O N ' S WA R N I N G


brought them to another level: the wild brand on nonmeasurable
uncertainty we discuss in Chapter l 0.What is also interesting is
that he discovered that we are designed by mother nature to have
an extremely skewed physical workout: Hunter-gatherers had
idle moments followed by bursts of intense energy expenditure.
At sixty-five, Art is said to have the physique of a man close to
half his age.
   In the markets, there is a category of traders who have inverse
rare events, for whom volatility is often a bearer of good news.
These traders lose money frequently, but in small amounts, and
make money rarely, but in large amounts.I call them crisis hunters.
I am happy to be one of them.

          Why Don't Statisticians Detect Rare Events?
Statistics t o the layman can appear rather complex, but the con­
cept behind what is used today is so simple that my French math­
ematician friends call it deprecatorily "cuisine." It is all based on
one simple notion: the more information you have, the more you
are confident about the outcome. Now the problem: by how
much? Common statistical method is based on the steady aug­
mentation of the confidence level, in nonlinear proportion to the
number of observations.That is, for an n times increase in the sam­
ple size, we increase our knowledge by the square root of n. Sup­
pose I am drawing from an urn containing red and black balls.My
confidence level about the relative proportion of red and black
balls after 20 drawings is not twice the one I have after 10 draw­
ings; it is merely multiplied by the square root of 2 (that is, 1.4 1) .
   Where statistics becomes complicated, and fails us, i s when we
have distributions that are not symmetric, like the urn above. If
there is a very small probability of finding a red ball in an urn dom­
inated by black ones, then our knowledge about the absence of red
balls will increase very slowly-more slowly than at the expected
square root of n rate. On the other hand, our knowledge of the
                S K EW N E S S A N D A S Y M M E T R Y   11 3


presence of red balls will dramatically improve once one of them is
found.This asymmetry in knowledge is not trivial; it is central in
this book-it is a central philosophical problem for such people as
Hume and Karl Popper (on that, later) .
   To assess an investor's performance, we either need more as­
tute, and less intuitive, techniques or we may have to limit our as­
sessments to situations where our j udgment is independent of the
frequency of these events.

         A Mischievous Child Replaces the Black Balls
But there is even worse news.In some cases, if the incidence of red
balls is itself randomly distributed, we will never get to know the
composition of the urn.This is called "the problem of stationarity."
Think of an urn that is hollow at the bottom.As I am sampling
from it, and without my being aware of it, some mischievous child
is adding balls of one color or another. My inference thus becomes
insignificant. I may infer that the red balls represent 50% of the
urn while the mischievous child, hearing me, would swiftly re­
place all the red balls with black ones.This makes much of our
knowledge derived through statistics quite shaky.
   The very same effect takes place in the market.We take past
history as a single homogeneous sample and believe that we have
considerably increased our knowledge of the future from the ob­
servation of the sample of the past. What if vicious children were
changing the composition of the urn? In other words, what if
things have changed?
   I have studied and practiced econometrics for more than half
my life (since I was nineteen) , both in the classroom and in the ac­
tivity of a quantitative derivatives trader. The "science" of econo­
metrics consists of the application of statistics to samples taken at
different periods of time, which we called "time series." It is based
on studying the time series of economic variables, data, and other
matters.In the beginning, when I knew close to nothing (that is,
                      114   S O L O N ' S WAR N I N G


even less than today), I wondered whether the time series reflect­
ing the activity of people now dead or retired should matter for
predicting the future. Econometricians who knew a lot more than
I did about these matters asked no such question; this hinted
that it was in all likelihood a stupid inquiry. One prominent
econometrician, Hashem Pesaran, answered a similar question by
recommending to do "more and better econometrics." I am now
convinced that, perhaps, most of econometrics could be useless­
much of what financial statisticians know would not be worth
knowing.For a sum of zeros, even repeated a billion times, remains
zero; likewise an accumulation of research and gains in complex­
ity will lead to naught if there is no firm ground beneath it. Study­
ing the European markets of the 1990s will certainly be of great
help to a historian; but what kind of inference can we make now
that the structure of the institutions and the markets has changed
so much?
    Note that the economist Robert Lucas dealt a blow to econo­
metrics by arguing that if people were rational then their rational­
ity would cause them to figure out predictable patterns from the
past and adapt, so that past information would be completely use­
less for predicting the future (the argument, phrased in a very
mathematical form, earned him the Swedish Central Bank Prize in
honor of Alfred Nobel).We are human and act according to our
knowledge, which integrates past data. I can translate his point
with the following analogy. If rational traders detect a pattern of
stocks rising on Mondays, then, immediately such a pattern be­
comes detectable, it would be ironed out by people buying on Fri­
 day in anticipation of such an effect. There is no point searching
 for patterns that are available to everyone with a brokerage ac­
 count; once detected, they would be self-canceling.
    Somehow, what came to be known as the Lucas critique was not
 carried through by the "scientists." It was confidently believed that
 the scientific successes of the industrial revolution could be car-
                S K EW N ES S A N D A S Y M M E T R Y   115


ried through into the social sciences, particularly with such move­
ments as Marxism. Pseudoscience came with a collection of ideal­
istic nerds who tried to create a tailor-made society, the epitome of
which is the central planner. Economics was the most likely can­
didate for such use of science; you can disguise charlatanism under
the weight of equations, and nobody can catch you since there is
no such thing as a controlled experiment. Now, the spirit of such
methods, called scientism by its detractors (like myself), contin­
ued past Marxism, into the discipline of finance as a few techni­
cians thought that their mathematical knowledge could lead them
to understand markets. The practice of "financial engineering "
came along with massive doses of pseudoscience. Practitioners of
these methods measure risks, using the tool of past history as an
indication of the future.We will just say at this point that the mere
possibility of the distributions not being stationary makes the en­
tire concept seem like a costly (perhaps very costly) mistake. This
leads us to a more fundamental question: The problem of induc­
tion, to which we will turn in the next chapter.

         There is a problem in inference well-known as the problem
of induction. It is a problem that has been haunting science for a
long time, but hard science has not been as harmed by it as the
social sciences, particularly economics, even more the branch of fi­
nancial economics. Why? Because the randomness content com­
pounds its effects. Nowhere is the problem of induction more
relevant than in the world of trading-and nowhere has it been as
ignored]

                             Cygnus Atratus
In his Treatise on Human Nature, the Scots philosopher David
Hume posed the issue in the following way (as rephrased in the
now famous black swan problem by John Stuart Mill) : No amount
of observations of white swans can allow the inference that all swans
are white, but the observation of a single black swan is sufficient to re­
fute that conclusion.
    Hume had been irked by the fact that science in his day (the
eighteenth century) had experienced a swing from scholasticism,
entirely based on deductive reasoning (no emphasis on the obser­
vation of the real world) to, owing to Francis B acon, an overreac­
tion into naive and unstructured empiricism. Bacon had argued
against "spinning the cobweb of learning" with little practical re­
sult (science resembled theology) . Science had shifted, thanks to
Bacon, into an emphasis on empirical observation. The problem is
that, without a proper method, empirical observations can lead
you astray. Hume came to warn us against such knowledge, and to
stress the need for some rigor in the gathering and interpretation
of knowledge-what is called epistemology (from episteme, Greek
for learning) . Hume is the first modern epistemologist (epistemolo­
gists operating in the applied sciences are often called methodolo­
gists or philosophers of science) . What I am writing here is not
strictly true, for Hume said things far worse than that; he was an
obsessive skeptic and never believed that a link between two
 items could be truly established as being causal. But we will tone
 him down a bit for this book.

                               Niederhoffer
The story of Victor Niederhoffer is both sad and interesting inso­
far as it shows the difficulty of merging extreme empiricism and
logic in one single person-pure empiricism implies necessarily
being fooled by randomness. I am bringing up his example be-
                      118   S O L O N ' S WARN I N G


cause, in a way, similar to Francis Bacon, Victor Niederhoffer stood
against the cobweb of learning of the University of Chicago and
the efficient-market religion of the 1960s when they were at their
worst. In contrast to the scholasticism of financial theorists, his
work looked at data in search of anomalies and found some. He
also figured out the uselessness of the news, as he showed that
reading the newspaper did not confer a predictive advantage to its
readers. He derived his knowledge of the world from past data
stripped of preconceptions, commentaries, and stories. Since then,
an entire industry of such operators, called statistical arbitrageurs,
flourished; some of the successful ones were initially his trainees.
Niederhoffer's story illustrates how empiricism cannot be insepa­
rable from methodology.
    At the center of his modus is Niederhoffer's dogma that any
"testable" statement should be tested, as our minds make plenty of
empirical mistakes when relying on vague impressions.His advice
is obvious, but it is rarely practiced.How many effects we take for
granted might not be there? A testable statement is one that can
be broken down into quantitative components and subjected to
statistical examination. For instance, a conventional-wisdom, em­
pirical style statement like

   automobile accidents happen closer to home


can be tested by taking the average distance between the accident
and the domicile of the driver (if, say, about 20% of accidents hap­
pen within a twelve-mile radius).However, one needs to be care­
ful in the interpretation; a naive reader of the result would tell you
that you are more likely to have an accident if you drive in your
neighborhood than if you did so in remote places, which is a typi­
cal example of naive empiricism.Why? Because accidents may
happen closer to home simply because people spend their time
driving close to home (if people spend 20% of their time driving
in a twelve-mile radius).
                T l-I E PRO B L E M O F I N D U C T I O N   119


   But there is a more severe aspect of naive empiricism. I can use
data to disprove a proposition, never to prove one. I can use his­
tory to refute a conjecture, never to affirm it. For instance, the
statement


   The market never goes down 20% in a given three-month period

can be tested but is completely meaningless if verified.I can quan­
titatively reject the proposition by finding counterexamples, but it
is not possible for me to accept it simply because, in the past, the
market never went down 20% in any three-month period (you
cannot easily make the logical leap from "has never gone down " to
"never goes down") . Samples can be greatly insufficient; markets
may change; we may not know much about the market from his­
torical information.
   You can more safely use the data to reject than to confirm hy­
potheses.Why? Consider the following statements:


   Statement A: No swan is black, because I looked at four thousand
   swans and found none.
   Statement B: Not all swans are white.

I cannot logically make statement A, no matter how many succes­
sive white swans I may have observed in my life and may observe
in the future (except, of course, if I am given the privilege of ob­
serving with certainty all available swans) . It is, however, possible
to make Statement B merely by finding one single counterexam­
ple. Indeed, Statement A was disproved by the discovery of Aus­
tralia, as it led to the sighting of the Cygnus atratus, a swan variety
that was jet black! The reader will see a hint of Popper's ideas, as
there is a strong asymmetry between the two statements; and, fur­
thermore, such asymmetry lies in the foundations of knowledge.It
is also at the core of my operation as a decision maker under un­
certainty.
                     120   S O L O N ' S WAR N I N G


   I said that people rarely test testable statements; this may be
better for those who cannot handle the consequence of the infer­
ence.The following inductive statement illustrates the problem of
interpreting past data literally, without methodology or logic:

  I have just completed a thorough statistical examination of the
  life of President Bush. For fifty-eight years, close to 21,000 ob­
  servations, he did not die once.I can hence pronounce him as
  immortal, with a high degree of statistical significance.

   Niederhoffer's publicized hiccup came from his selling naked
options based on his testing and assuming that what he saw in the
past was an exact generalization about what could happen in the
future. He relied on the statement "The market has never done
this before," so he sold puts that made a small income if the state­
ment was true and lost hugely in the event of it turning out to be
wrong.When he blew up, close to a couple of decades of per­
formance were overshadowed by a single event that only lasted a
few minutes.
    Another logical flaw in this type of historical statement is that
often when a large event takes place, you hear the "it never hap­
pened before, " as if it needed to be absent from the event's past
history for it to be a surprise. So why do we consider the worst
case that took place in our own past as the worst possible case? If
the past, by bringing surprises, did not resemble the past previous
to it (what I call the past's past) , then why should our future re­
semble our current past?
    There is another lesson to his story, perhaps the greatest one:
Niederhoffer appears to approach markets as a venue from which
to derive pride, status, and wins against "opponents " (such as my­
 self), as he would in a game with defined rules.He was a squash
 champion with a serious competitive streak; it is just that reality
 does not have the same closed and symmetric laws and regulations
 as games.This competitive nature got him into ferocious fighting
                T l-I E PR O B L E M O F I N D U CT I O N   121


to "win." A s w e saw i n the last chapter, markets ( and life) are not
simple win/lose types of situations, as the cost of the losses can be
markedly different from that of the wins. Maximizing the proba­
bility of winning does not lead to maximizing the expectation
from the game when one's strategy may include skewness, i.e., a
small chance of large loss and a large chance of a small win.If you
engaged in a Russian roulette-type strategy with a low probability
of large loss, one that bankrupts you every several years, you are
likely to show up as the winner in almost all samples-except in
the year when you are dead.
   I remind myself never to fail to acknowledge the insights of the
1960s empiricist and his early contributions. Sadly, I learned quite
a bit from Niederhoffer, mostly by contrast, and particularly from
the last example: not to approach anything as a game to win, ex­
cept, of course, if it is a game. Even then, I do not like the asphyx­
iating structure of competitive games and the diminishing aspect
of deriving pride from a numerical performance. I also learned to
stay away from people of a competitive nature, as they have a ten­
dency to commoditize and reduce the world to categories, like
how many papers they publish in a given year, or how they rank in
the league tables. There is something nonphilosophical about in­
vesting one's pride and ego into a "my house/library/car is bigger
than that of others in my category "-it is downright foolish to
claim to be first in one's category all the while sitting on a time
bomb.
  To conclude, extreme empiricism, competitiveness, and an ab­
sence of logical structure to one's inference can be a quite explo­
sive combination.

Next I will discuss how I discovered Karl Popper via another
trader, perhaps the only one I have ever truly respected. I do not
                     122   S O L O N ' S WAR N I N G


know if it applies to other people, but, in spite of my being a vo­
racious reader, I have rarely been truly affected in my behavior (in
any durable manner) by anything I have read.A book can make a
strong impression, but such an impression tends to wane after
some newer impression replaces it in my brain (a new book) . I
have to discover things by myself (recall the "Stove Is Hot " section
in Chapter 3 ) .These self-discoveries last.
   One exception of ideas that stuck with me are those of Sir Karl,
whom I discovered (or perhaps rediscovered) through the writ­
ings of the trader and self-styled philosopher George Soros, who
seemed to have organized his life by becoming a promoter of the
ideas of Karl Popper. What I learned from George Soros was not
quite in the way he perhaps intended us to learn from him. I dis­
agreed with his statements when it came to economics and
philosophy. First, although I admire him greatly, I agree with pro­
fessional thinkers that Soros' forte is not in philosophical spec­
ulation. Yet he considers himself a philosopher-which makes
him endearing in more than one way. Take his first book, The
Alchemy of Finance. On the one hand, he seems to discuss ideas of
scientific explanation by throwing in big names like "deductive­
nomological, " something always suspicious as it is reminiscent of
postmodern writers who play philosophers and scientists by using
 complicated references. On the other hand, he does not show
much grasp of the concepts. For instance, he conducts what he
 calls a "trading experiment, " and uses the success of the trade to
 imply that the theory behind it is valid. This is ludicrous: I could
 roll the dice to prove my religious beliefs and show the favorable
 outcome as evidence that my ideas are right. The fact that Soros'
 speculative portfolio turned a profit proves very little of anything.
 One cannot infer much from a single experiment in a random en­
 vironment-an experiment needs a repeatability showing some
 causal component. Second, Soros indicts wholesale the science of
 economics, which may be very justified but he did not do his
               T l-I E P R O B L E M O F I N D U C T I O N   1 23


homework. For instance, he writes that the category of people he
lumps as "economists " believe that things converge to equilibrium,
when that only applies to some cases of neoclassical economics.
There are plenty of economic theories that believe that departure
from a price level can cause further divergence and cause cascad­
ing feedback loops.There has been considerable research to that
effect in, say, game theory (the works of Harsanyi and Nash) or in­
formation economics (the works of Stiglitz, Akerlof, and Spence) .
Lumping all economics in one basket shows a bit of unfairness and
lack of rigor.
   But in spite of some of the nonsense in his writing, probably
aimed at convincing himself that he was not just a trader, or be­
cause of it, I succumbed to the charm of this Hungarian man who
like me is ashamed of being a trader and prefers his trading to be a
minor extension of his intellectual life even if there is not much
scholarship in his essays.Having never been impressed by people
with money (and I have met plenty of those throughout my life) ,
I did not look at any of them as remotely a role model for me.Per­
haps the opposite effect holds, as I am generally repelled by the
wealthy, generally because of the attitude of epic heroism that
usually accompanies rapid enrichment. Soros was the only one
who seemed to share my values. He wanted to be taken seriously
as a Middle European professor who happened to have gotten rich
owing to the validity of his ideas (it was only by failing to gain ac­
ceptance by other intellectuals that he would try to gain alpha sta­
tus through his money, sort of like a seducer who, after trying
hard, would end up using such an appendage as the red Ferrari to
seduce the girl) . In addition, although Soros did not deliver any­
thing meaningful in his writings, he knew how to handle random­
ness, by keeping a critical open mind and changing his opinions
with minimal shame (which carries the side effect of making him
treat people like napkins) .He walked around calling himself falli­
ble, but was so potent because he knew it while others had loftier
                      124   S O L O N ' S WAR N I N G


ideas about themselves. He understood Popper. Do not judge him
by his writings: He lived a Popperian life.
   As an aside, Popper was not new to me. I had briefly heard of
Karl Popper when I was in my teens and early twenties, as part of
a motivated education in Europe and the United States. But I did
not understand his ideas as presented then, nor did I think it
would be important (like metaphysics) for anything in life . I was
at the age when one felt like one needed to read everything,
which prevented one from making contemplative stops. Such
hurry made it hard to detect that there was something important
in Popper. It was either my conditioning by the intellectual-chic
culture at the time (too much Plato, too many Marxists, too much
Hegel, too many pseudoscientific intellectuals), the educational
system (too many conjectures propounded as truth) , or the fact
that I was too young and was reading too much then to make a
bridge to reality.
   Popper then slipped out of my mind without hanging on a sin­
gle brain cell-there was nothing in the baggage of a boy without
experience to let it stick. Besides, having started trading, I entered
an anti-intellectual phase; I needed to make a nonrandom buck to
secure my newly lost future and wealth that had just evaporated
with the Lebanese war (until then I was living with the desire to
become a comfortable man of leisure like almost everyone in my
family over the past two centuries) .I suddenly felt financially in­
secure and feared becoming an employee of some firm that would
turn me into a corporate slave with "work ethics " (whenever I hear
work ethics I interpret inefficient mediocrity). I needed the backing
of my bank account so I could buy time to think and enjoy life.
The last thing I needed was immediate philosophizing and work at
the local McDonald's. Philosophy, to me, became something
rhetorical people did when they had plenty of time on their
hands; it was an activity reserved for those who were not well
versed in quantitative methods and other productive things.It was
               T l-I E: PR O B L E: M O J: I N D U C T I O N   1 25


a pastime that should be limited to late hours, in bars around the
campuses, when one had a few drinks and a light schedule-pro­
vided one forgot the garrulous episode as early as the next day. Too
much of it can get a man in trouble, perhaps turn one into a Marx­
ist ideologue.Popper was not to reemerge until I secured my ca­
reer as a trader.

                           Location, Location
It is said that people generally remember the time and geographic
condition where they were swept with a governing idea.The reli­
gious poet and diplomat Paul Claude} remembers the exact spot
of his conversion (or reconversion) to Catholicism in the Cathe­
dral Notre-Dame of Paris, near a precise column. Thus I remem­
ber exactly the spot at Barnes and Noble on Eighteenth Street and
Fifth Avenue where in 1 9 87, inspired by Soros, I read fifty pages of
The Open Society and feverishly bought all the Popper titles I
could get my hands on lest they run out of stock. It was in a
sparsely lit side-room that had a distinctive smell of mildew. I re­
member vividly the thoughts that rushed through my head like a
revelation.
   Popper turned out to be exactly the opposite of what I initially
thought about "philosophers"; he was the epitome of no nonsense.
By then I had been an option trader for a couple of years and I felt
angry that I was being taken for a total ride by the academic re­
searchers in finance, particularly since I was deriving my income
from the failure of their models. I had already started talking to fi­
nance academics as part of my involvement with derivatives and I
had trouble getting through to them some basic points about fi­
nancial markets (they believed in their models a little too much) .
There was all along lurking in my mind the idea that these re­
searchers had missed a point, but I did not quite know what it was.
It was not what they knew, it was how they knew it, that was the
subject of my annoyance.

                            Popper's Answer
Popper came up with a major answer to the problem of induction
(to me he came up with the answer) . No man has influenced the
way scientists do science more than Sir Karl-in spite of the fact
that many of his fellow professional philosophers find him quite
naive (to his credit, in my opinion) .Popper's idea is that science is
not to be taken as seriously as it sounds (Popper when meeting
Einstein did not take him as the demigod he thought he was) .
There are only two types of theories:

1. Theories that are known to be wrong, as they were tested and
   adequately rejected (he calls them falsified).
2. Theories that have not yet been known to be wrong, not falsi­
   fied yet, but are exposed to be proved wrong.

    Why is a theory never right? Because we will never know if all
the swans are white (Popper borrowed the Kantian idea of the
flaws in our mechanisms of perception) . The testing mechanism
may be faulty. However, the statement that there is a black swan
is possible to make. A theory cannot be verified. To paraphrase
baseball coach Yogi Berra again, past data has a lot ofgood in it, but
it is the bad side that is bad. It can only be provisionally accepted.
A theory that falls outside of these two categories is not a theory.
A theory that does not present a set of conditions under which it
would be considered wrong would be termed charlatanism-it­
would be impossible to reject otherwise.Why? Because the astrol­
ogist can always find a reason to fit the past event, by saying that
Mars was probably in line but not too much so (likewise to me a
trader who does not have a point that would make him change his
mind is not a trader) . Indeed the difference between Newtonian
physics, which was falsified by Einstein's relativity, and astrology
lies in the following irony. Newtonian physics is scientific because
               T l-I E PR O B L E M 0 1= I N D U C T I O N   1 27


it allowed us to falsify it, as we know that it is wrong, while as­
trology is not because it does not offer conditions under which we
could reject it.Astrology cannot be disproved, owing to the auxil­
iary hypotheses that come into play. Such point lies at the basis of
the demarcation between science and nonsense ( called "the prob­
lem of demarcation ") .
   More practically to me, Popper had many problems with statis­
tics and statisticians. He refused to blindly accept the notion that
knowledge can always increase with incremental information­
which is the foundation of statistical inference.It may in some in­
stances, but we do not know which ones.Many insightful people,
such as John Maynard Keynes, independently reached the same
conclusions. Sir Karl's detractors believe that favorably repeating
the same experiment again and again should lead to an increased
comfort with the notion that "it works." I came to understand Pop­
per's position better once I saw the first rare event ravaging a trad­
ing room. Sir Karl feared that some type of knowledge did not
increase with information-but which type we could not ascer­
tain.The reason I feel that he is important for us traders is because
to him the matter of knowledge and discovery is not so much in
dealing with what we know as in dealing with what we do not
know.His famous quote:

  These are men with bold ideas, but highly critical of their own
  ideas; they try to find whether their ideas are right by trying first
   to find whether they are not perhaps wrong. They work with
   bold conjectures and severe attempts at refuting their own con­
   jectures.

"These " are scientists.But they could be anything.
  Putting the master in context, Popper was rebelling against the
growth of science. Popper intellectually came to the world with
the dramatic shifts in philosophy as attempts were made to shift it
                     128   S O L O N ' S WAR N I N G


from the verbal and rhetorical to the scientific and rigorous, as we
saw with the presentation of the Vienna Circle in Chapter 4 .
These people were sometimes called the logical positivists, after
the movement called positivism pioneered in France in the nine­
teenth century by Auguste Comte, where positivism meant scien­
tification of things (literally everything under the sun). It was the
equivalent of bringing the industrial revolution into the soft sci­
ences.Without dwelling on positivism, I have to note that Popper
is the antidote to positivism. To him, verification is not possible.
Verificationism is more dangerous than anything else.Taken to the
extreme, Popper's ideas appear naive and primitive-but they
work. Note that his detractors call him a naive falsificationist.
    I am an exceedingly naive falsificationist.Why? Because I can
survive being one. My extreme and obsessive Popperism is car­
ried out as follows. I speculate in all of my activities on theories
that represent some vision of the world, but with the following
stipulation: No rare event should harm me. In fact, I would like
all conceivable rare events to help me. My idea of science di­
verges with that of the people around me walking around calling
themselves scientists. Science is mere speculation, mere formula­
tion of conjecture.

                           Open Society
Popper's falsificationism is intimately connected to the notion of
an open society. An open society is one in which no permanent
truth is held to exist; this would allow counter-ideas to emerge.
Karl Popper shared ideas with his friend, the low-key economist
von Hayek, who endorsed capitalism as a state in which prices can
disseminate information that bureaucratic socialism would choke.
Both notions of falsificationism and open society are, counterintu­
itively, connected to those of a rigorous method for handling ran­
domness in my day job as a trader. Clearly, an open mind is a
necessity when dealing with randomness.Popper believed that any
                T l-I E: PRO B L E M 0 1= I N D U C T I O N   129


idea of Utopia i s necessarily closed owing t o the fact that i t chokes
its own refutations.The simple notion of a good model for society
that cannot be left open for falsification is totalitarian.I learned
from Popper, in addition to the difference between an open and a
closed society, that between an open and a closed mind.

                            Nobody Is Perfect
I have some sobering information about Popper the man.Wit­
nesses of his private life find him rather un-Popperian. The
philosopher and Oxford don Bryan Magee who befriended him
for close to three decades depicts him as unworldly (except in his
youth) and narrowly focused on his work. He spent the last fifty
years of his long career (Popper lived ninety-two years) closed to
the outside world, insulated from outside distractions and stimu­
lation.Popper also engaged in giving people "firm sounding advice
about their career or their private life, though he had little un­
derstanding of either. All this, of course, was in direct contraven­
tion of his professed ( and indeed genuine) beliefs, and practices,
in philosophy."
   He was not much better in his youth.Members of the Vienna
Circle tried to avoid him, not because of his divergent ideas but
because he was a social problem. "He was brilliant, but self­
focused, both insecure and arrogant, irascible and self-righteous.
He was a terrible listener and bent on winning arguments at all
costs.He had no understanding of group dynamics and no ability
to negotiate them."
   I will refrain from commonplace discourse about the divorce
between those who have ideas and those who carry them in prac­
tice, except to bring out the interesting behavioral problem; we
like to emit logical and rational ideas but we do not necessarily
enjoy this execution.Strange as it sounds, this point has only been
discovered very recently (we will see that we are not genetically fit
to be rational and act rationally; we are merely fit for the maxi-
                     1 30   S O L O N ' S WAR N I N G


mum probability of transmitting our genes in some given unso­
phisticated environment) . Also, strange as it sounds, George Soros,
obsessively self-critical, seems to be more Popperian than Popper
in his professional behavior.

                      Induction and Memory
Memory in humans is a large machine to make inductive infer­
ences.Think of memories: What is easier to remember, a collection
of random facts glued together, or a story, something that offers a
series of logical links? Causality is easier to commit to memory.
Our brain would have less work to do in order to retain the infor­
mation.The size is smaller.What is induction exactly? Induction is
going from plenty of particulars to the general.It is very handy, as
the general takes much less room in one's memory than a collec­
tion of particulars.The effect of such compression is the reduction
in the degree of detected randomness.

                            Pascal's Wager
I conclude with the exposition of my own method of dealing with
the problem of induction. The philosopher Pascal proclaimed that
the optimal strategy for humans is to believe in the existence of
God.For if God exists, then the believer would be rewarded.If he
does not exist, the believer would have nothing to lose. Accord­
ingly, we need to accept the asymmetry in knowledge; there are
situations in which using statistics and econometrics can be useful.
But I do not want my life to depend on it.
    Like Pascal, I will therefore state the following argument.If the
science of statistics can benefit me in anything, I will use it. If it
poses a threat, then I will not. I want to take the best of what the
past can give me without its dangers.Accordingly, I will use statis­
tics and inductive methods to make aggressive bets, but I will not
use them to manage my risks and exposure. Surprisingly, all the
surviving traders I know seem to have done the same.They trade
on ideas based on some observation (that includes past history)
                T l-I E PR O B L E M 0 1= I N D U CT I O N   1 31


but, like the Popperian scientists, they make sure that the costs of
being wrong are limited (and their probability is not derived from
past data) . Unlike Carlos and John, they know before getting in­
volved in the trading strategy which events would prove their con­
jecture wrong and allow for it (recall that Carlos and John used
past history both to make their bets and to measure their risk) .
They would then terminate their trade. This is called a stop loss, a
predetermined exit point, a protection from the black swan. I find
it rarely practiced.


                     TI--I A N K Y O U , S O L O N

Finally, I have to confess th at upon finishing my writing of Part I,
that writing about the genius of Solon's insight has carried an ex­
treme effect on both my thinking and my private life. The compo­
sition of Part I made me even more confident in my withdrawal
from the media and my distancing myself from other members of
the business community, mostly other investors and traders for
whom I am developing more and more contempt. I believe that I
cannot have power over myself as I have an ingrained desire to in­
tegrate among people and cultures and would end up resembling
them; by withdrawing myself entirely I can have a better control
of my fate. I am currently enjoying a thrill of the classics I have not
felt since childhood. I am now thinking of the next step : to re­
create a low-information, more deterministic ancient time, say in
the nineteenth century, all the while benefiting from some of the
technical gains (such as the Monte Carlo engine), all of the med­
ical breakthroughs, and all the gains of social justice of our age. I
would then have the best of everything. This is called evolution.

  f one puts an infinite number of monkeys in front of (strongly
  built) typewriters, and lets them clap away, there is a certainty
  that one of them would come out with an exact version of the
Iliad. Upon examination, this may be less interesting a concept
than it appears at first: Such probability is ridiculously low. But
let us carry the reasoning one step beyond. Now that we have
found that hero among monkeys, would any reader invest his
life's savings on a bet that the monkey would write the Odyssey
next?
  In this thought experiment, it is the second step that is inter­
esting. How much can past performance (here the typing of the
Iliad) be relevant in forecasting future performance? The same ap­
plies to any decision based on past performance, merely relying on
the attributes of the past time series. Think about the monkey
showing up at your door with his impressive past performance.
Hey, he wrote the Iliad.
   The major problem with inference in general is that those
whose profession is to derive conclusions from data often fall into
the trap faster and more confidently than others.The more data
we have, the more likely we are to drown in it.For common wis­
dom among people with a budding knowledge of probability laws
is to base their decision making on the following principle: It is
                 136   M O N KEY S O N T Y PE W R I TERS


very unlikely for someone to perform considerably well in a con­
sistent fashion without his doing something right. Track records
therefore become preeminent.They call on the rule of the likeli­
hood of such a successful run and tell themselves that if someone
performed better than the rest in the past then there is a great
chance of his performing better than the crowd in the future-and
a very great one at that. But, as usual, beware the middlebrow: A
small knowledge of probability can lead to worse results than no
knowledge at all.


   I T D E P E NDS ON T l-I E NU M B E R 0 1= M ONK E Y S

I do not deny that if someone performed better than the crowd in
the past, there is a presumption of his ability to do better in the fu­
ture.But the presumption might be weak, very weak, to the point
of being useless in decision making. Why? Because it all depends
on two factors : The randomness content of his profession and the
number of monkeys in operation.
   The initial sample size matters greatly.If there are five monkeys
in the game, I would be rather impressed with the Iliad writer, to
the point of suspecting him to be a reincarnation of the ancient
poet. If there are a billion to the power one billion monkeys I
would be less impressed-as a matter of fact I would be surprised
if one of them did not get some well-known (but unspecified)
piece of work, just by luck (perhaps Casanova's Memoirs of My
Life). One monkey would even be expected to provide us with
former vice president Al Gore's Earth in the Balance, perhaps
stripped of the platitudes.
    This problem enters the business world more viciously than
other walks of life, owing to the high dependence on randomness
 (we have already belabored the contrast between randomness­
dependent business with dentistry). The greater the number of
businessmen, the greater the likelihood of one of them performing
                M O N KEY S O N T Y PE W R I T ER S   1 37


in a stellar manner just by luck. I have rarely seen anyone count
the monkeys.In the same vein, few count the investors in the mar­
ket in order to calculate, instead of the probability of success, the
conditional probability of successful runs given the number of in­
vestors in operation over a given market history.


                    V I C IOUS REA L L I F E

There are other aspects t o the monkeys problem; i n real life the
other monkeys are not countable, let alone visible.They are hid­
den away, as one sees only the winners-it is natural for those
who failed to vanish completely. Accordingly, one sees the sur­
vivors, and only the survivors, which imparts such a mistaken
perception of the odds.We do not respond to probability, but to
society's assessment of it.As we saw with Nero Tulip, even peo­
ple with training in probability respond unintelligently to social
pressure.

Part I described situations where people do not understand the
rare event, and do not seem to accept either the possibility of its
occurrence or the dire consequences of such occurrence.It also set
out my own ideas, those that do not seem to have been explored
in the literature.But a book on randomness is not complete with­
out a presentation of what possible biases one might have aside
from the deformations caused by the rare event. The business of
Part II is more pedestrian; I will rapidly provide a synthesis of the
biases of randomness as discussed in the now abundant literature
on the subject.
   These biases can be outlined as follows: (a) The survivorship bi­
ases (a.k.a.monkeys on a typewriter) arising from the fact that we
see only winners and get a distorted view of the odds (Chapters 8
                1 38   M O N K EY S O N T Y PE W R I TER S


and 9, "Too Many Millionaires" and "Fry an Egg") , (b) the fact that
luck is most frequently the reason for extreme success (Chapter
1 0, "Loser Takes All"), and (c) the biological handicap of our in­
ability to understand probability (Chapter 1 1 , "Randomness and
Our Brain") .

lieve that the recent spurt in prosperity is here to last and has not
mentally adjusted yet to his recent abrupt rise in income.A rotund
man in his late forties, with spongy features that make him look
ten years older than his age, he leads the seemingly comfortable
(but heckled) life of a New York City lawyer. But he is on the

den and tend to be concerned, like many people of their age, men­
tality, and condition, with (in the following order) material
comfort, health, and status. Weekdays, he does not come home
until at least 9 : 3 0 p.m. and, at times, he can be found in the office
at close to midnight.By the end of the week, Marc is so fatigued
that he falls asleep during their three-hour drive to "the house";
and Marc spends most of Saturday lying in bed recovering and
healing.
    Marc grew up in a small town in the Midwest, the son of a
quiet tax accountant who worked with sharp yellow pencils. His
obsession with sharpness was so strong that he carried a sharp­
ener in his pocket at all times. Marc exhibited very early signs of
intelligence.He did extremely well in high school. He attended
Harvard College, then Yale Law School.Not bad, one would say.
Later his career took him to corporate law, where he started
working on large cases for a prestigious New York law firm, with
barely enough hours left for him to brush his teeth.T his is not too
much an exaggeration, for he ate almost all of his dinners in the
office, accumulating body fat and Brownie points toward his part­
nership. He later became a partner within the usual seven years,
but not without the usual human costs. His first wife (whom he
met in college) left him, as she was tired of an absentee lawyer
husband and weary of the deterioration in his conversation-but,
ironically, she ended up moving in with and later marrying an­
other New York lawyer, probably with a no-less-flat conversation,
but who made her happier.

                          Too Much Work
Marc's body became progressively flabbier, and his bespoke suits
needed periodic visits to the tailor, in spite of his occasional crash
diets. After he got over the depression of the abandonment, he
started dating Janet, his paralegal, and promptly married her.T hey

had three children in quick succession, bought the Park Avenue
apartment, and the country house.
  Janet's immediate acquaintance is composed of the other par­
ents of the Manhattan private school attended by their children,
and their neighbors at the co-operative apartment building where
they live. From a materialistic standpoint, they come at the low
end of such a set, perhaps even at the exact bottom. They would
be the poorest of these circles, as their co-op is inhabited by ex­
tremely successful corporate executives, Wall Street traders, and
high-flying entrepreneurs. Their children's private school harbors
the second set of children of corporate raiders, from their trophy
wives-perhaps even the third set, if one takes into account the
age discrepancy and the model-like features of the other mothers.
By comparison, Marc's wife, Janet, like him, presents a homely
country-home-with-a-rose-garden type of appearance.

                            You 're a Failure
Marc's strategy of staying in Manhattan may be rational, as his de­
manding work hours would make it impossible for him to com­
mute. But the costs on his wife, Janet, are monstrous. Why?
Because of their relative nonsuccess-as geographically defined by
their Park Avenue neighborhood. Every month or so, Janet has a
crisis, giving in to the strains and humiliations of being snubbed by
some other mother at the school where she picks up the children,
or another woman with larger diamonds by the elevator of the co­
op where they live in the smallest type of apartments (the G line) .
Why isn't her husband so successful? Isn't he smart and hard­
working? Didn't he get close to 1 600 on the SAT? Why is this
Ronald Something, whose wife never even nods to Janet, worth
hundreds of millions, when her husband went to Harvard and Yale
and has such a high IQ and has hardly any substantial savings?
  We will not get too involved in the Chekhovian dilemmas in
the private lives of Marc and Janet, but their case provides a very
                 142   M O N K E Y S O N T Y PE WR I T ERS


common illustration of the emotional effect of survivorship bias.
Janet feels that her husband is a failure, by comparison, but she is
miscomputing the probabilities in a gross manner-she is using
the wrong distribution to derive a rank.As compared to the gen­
eral U.S. population, Marc has done very well, better than 99.5%
of his compatriots.As compared to his high school friends, he did
extremely well, a fact that he could have verified had he had time
to attend the periodic reunions, and he would come at the top. As
compared to the other people at Harvard, he did better than 90%
of them (financially, of course) . As compared to his law school
comrades at Yale, he did better than 60% of them. But as com­
pared to his co-op neighbors, he is at the bottom! Why? Because
he chose to live among the people who have been successful, in an
area that excludes failure. In other words, those who have failed
do not show up in the sample, thus making him look as if he were
not doing well at all. By living on Park Avenue, one does not have
exposure to the losers, one only sees the winners.As we are cut to
live in very small communities, it is difficult to assess our situation
outside of the narrowly defined geographic confines of our habi­
tat. In the case of Marc and Janet, this leads to considerable emo­
tional distress; here we have a woman who married an extremely
successful man but all she can see is comparative failure, for she
cannot emotionally compare him to a sample that would do him
justice.
    Aside from the misperception of one's performance, there is a
social treadmill effect: You get rich, move to rich neighborhoods,
then become poor again.To that add the psychological treadmill
effect; you get used to wealth and revert to a set point of satisfac­
tion.This problem of some people never really getting to feel sat­
isfied by wealth (beyond a given point) has been the subject of
technical discussions on happiness.
    Someone would rationally say to Janet: "Go read this book
Fooled by Randomness by one mathematical trader on the defor-
          T O O M A N Y M I L L I O N A I RES N E X T D O O R   143


mations of chance in life; it would give you a statistical sense of
perspective and would accordingly make you feel better. " As an
author, I would like to offer a panacea for $ 1 4.9 5 , but I would
rather say that in my best hopes it may provide an hour or so of
solace.Janet may need something more drastic for relief I have re­
peated that becoming more rational, or not feeling emotions of so­
cial slights, is not part of the human race, at least not with our
current biology. There is no solace to be found from reasoning-as
a trader I have learned something about these unfruitful efforts to
reason against the grain.I would advise Janet to move out, and go
live in some blue-collar neighborhood where they would feel less
humiliated by their neighbors and rise in the pecking order be­
yond their probability of success.They could use the deformation
in the opposite direction. If Janet cares about status, then I would
even recommend some of these large housing blocks.

                              More Experts
I recently read a bestseller called The Millionaire Next Door, an ex­
tremely misleading (but almost enjoyable) book by two "experts, "
in which the authors try to infer some attributes that are common
to rich people. They examined a collection of currently wealthy
people and found out that these are unlikely to lead lavish lives.
They call such people the accumulators; persons ready to post­
pone consumption in order to amass funds. Most of the appeal of
the book comes from the simple but counterintuitive fact that
these are less likely to look like very rich people-it clearly costs
money to look and behave rich, not to count the time demands of
spending money. Leading prosperous lives is time-consuming­
shopping for trendy clothes, becoming conversant in Bordeaux
wines, getting to know the expensive restaurants.All these activi­
ties can put high demands on one's time and divert the subject
                144   M O N K EY S O N T Y PE W R I TERS


from what should be the real preoccupation, namely the accumu­
lation of nominal (and paper) wealth. The moral of the book is
that the wealthiest are to be found among those less suspected to
be wealthy. On the other hand, those who act and look wealthy
subject their net worth to such a drain that they inflict consider­
able and irreversible damage to their brokerage account.
    I will set aside the point that I see no special heroism in accu­
mulating money, particularly if, in addition, the person is foolish
enough to not even try to derive any tangible benefit from the
wealth (aside from the pleasure of regularly counting the beans) .
I have no large desire to sacrifice much of my personal habits, in­
tellectual pleasures, and personal standards in order to become a
billionaire like Warren Buffett, and I certainly do not see the
point of becoming one if I were to adopt Spartan (even miserly)
habits and live in my starter house. Something about the praise
lavished upon him for living in austerity while being so rich es­
capes me; if austerity is the end, he should become a monk or a
social worker-we should remember that becoming rich is a
purely selfish act, not a social one.The virtue of capitalism is that
society can take advantage of people's greed rather than their
benevolence, but there is no need to, in addition, extol such greed
as a moral (or intellectual) accomplishment (the reader can easily
see that, aside from very few exceptions like George Soros, I am
not impressed by people with money) . Becoming rich is not di­
rectly a moral achievement, but that is not where the severe flaw
in the book lies.
    As we saw, the heroes of The Millionaire Next Door are the ac­
cumulators, people who defer spending in order to invest.It is un­
deniable that such strategy might work; money spent bears no
fruit (except the enjoyment of the spender) . But the benefits
promised in the book seem grossly overstated.A finer read of their
thesis reveals that their sample includes a double dose of survivor­
ship bias. In other words, it has two compounding flaws.
          T O O M A N Y M I L L I O N A I RES N E X T D O O R   145




                           Visibility Winners
The first bias comes from the fact that the rich people selected
for their sample are among the lucky monkeys on typewriters.
The authors made no attempt to correct their statistics with the
fact that they saw only the winners.They make no mention of the
"accumulators " who have accumulated the wrong things (mem­
bers of my family are experts on that; those who accumulated
managed to accumulate currencies about to be devalued and
stocks of companies that later went bust) . Nowhere do we see a
mention of the fact that some people were lucky enough to have
invested in the winners; these people no doubt would make their
way into the book. There is a way to take care of the bias: Lower
the wealth of your average millionaire by, say, 50%, on the
grounds that the bias causes the average net worth of the ob­
served millionaire to be higher by such amount (it consists in
adding the effect of the losers into the pot) . It would certainly
modify the conclusion.

                           It 's a Bull Market
As to the second, more serious flaw, I have already discussed the
problem of induction. The story focuses on an unusual episode in
history; buying its thesis implies accepting that the current re­
turns in asset values are permanent (the sort of belief that pre­
vailed before the great crash that started in 1 929). Remember
that asset prices have (still at the time of writing) witnessed the
greatest bull market in history and that values did compound as­
tronomically during the past two decades. A dollar invested in
the average stock would have grown almost twenty-fold since
1 982-and that is the average stock. The sample might include
people who invested in stocks performing better than average.
Virtually all of the subjects became rich from asset price infla­
tion, in other words from the recent inflation in financial paper
                146   M O N K E Y S O N T Y PE W R I TERS


and assets that started in 1982.An investor who engaged in the
same strategy during less august days for the market would cer­
tainly have a different story to tell. Imagine the book being writ­
ten in 19 82, after the prolonged erosion of the inflation-adjusted
value of the stocks, or in 193 5 , after the loss of interest in the
stock market.
    Or consider that the United States stock market is not the only
investment vehicle. Consider the fate of those who, in place of
spending their money buying expensive toys and paying for ski
trips, bought Lebanese lira denominated Treasury bills (as my
grandfather did), or junk bonds from Michael Milken (as many of
my colleagues in the 1980s did) . Go back in history and imagine
the accumulator buying Russian Imperial bonds bearing the signa­
ture of Czar Nicholas II and trying to accumulate further by cash­
ing them from the Soviet government, or Argentine real estate in
the 1930s (as my great-grandfather did) .
    The mistake of ignoring the survivorship bias is chronic, even
( or perhaps especially) among professionals. How? Because we
are trained to take advantage of the information that is lying in
front of our eyes, ignoring the information that we do not see.
At the time of writing, pension funds and insurance companies
in the United States and in Europe somehow bought the argu­
ment that "in the long term equities always pay off 9%" and
back it up with statistics. The statistics are right, but they are
past history. My argument is that I can find you a security some­
where among the 40, 000 available that went up twice that
amount every year without fail. Should we put the social secu­
rity money into it?
    A brief summing up at this point: I showed how we tend to mis­
take one realization among all possible random histories as the most
representative one, forgetting that there may be others.In a nutshell,
the survivorship bias implies that the highest performing realization
will be the most visible. Why? Because the losers do not show up.

                      A GURU ' S O P INION

The fund management industry is populated with gurus. Clearly,
the field is randomness-laden and the guru is going to fall into a
trap, particularly if he has no proper training in inference. At the
time of writing, there is one such guru who developed the very
unfortunate habit of writing books on the subject.Along with one
of his peers, he computed the success of a "Robin Hood" policy of
investing with the least successful manager in a given population
of managers. It consists in switching down by taking money away
from the winner and allocating it to the loser.This goes against the
prevailing wisdom of investing with a winning manager and taking
away money from a losing one. Doing so, their "paper strategy"
(i.e., as in a Monopoly game, not executed in real life) derived con­
siderably higher returns than if they stuck to the winning manager.
Their hypothetical example seemed to them to prove that one
should not stay with the best manager, as we would be inclined to
do, but rather switch to the worst manager, or at least such seems
to be the point they were attempting to convey.
  Their analysis presents one severe hitch that any graduate stu­
dent should be able to pinpoint at the first reading.Their sample
only had survivors. They simply forgot to take into account the
managers who went out of business. Such a sample includes man­
agers that were operating during the simulation, �nd are still oper­
ating today. True, their sample included managers who did poorly,
but only those managers who did poorly and recovered, without
getting out of business.So it would be obvious that investing with
those who fared poorly at some point but recovered (with the
benefit of hindsight) would yield a positive return) Had they con­
tinued to fare poorly, they would be out of business and would not
be included in the sample.
   How should one conduct the proper simulation? By taking a
population of managers in existence, say, five years ago and run-
                 148   M O N K EY S O N T Y PE W R I TERS


ning the simulation up to today. Clearly, the attributes of those
who leave the population are biased toward failure; few successful
people in such a lucrative business call it quits because of extreme
success. Before we turn to a more technical presentation of these
issues, one mention of the much idealized buzzword of optimism.
Optimism, it is said, is predictive of success. Predictive? It can also
be predictive of failure. Optimistic people certainly take more
risks as they are overconfident about the odds; those who win
show up among the rich and famous, others fail and disappear
from the analyses. Sadly.

      his afternoon I have an appointment with my dentist (it will
      mostly consist in the dentist picking my brain on Brazilian
     bonds) . I can state with a certain level of comfort that he
knows something about teeth, particularly if I enter his office with
a toothache and exit it with some form of relief It will be difficult
for someone who knows literally nothing about teeth to provide
me with such relief, except if he is particularly lucky on that day­
or has been very lucky in his life to become a dentist while not
knowing anything about teeth. Looking at his diploma on the
wall, I determine that the odds that he repeatedly gave correct an-

swers to the exam questions and performed satisfactorily on a few
thousand cavities before his graduation-out of plain random­
ness-are remarkably small.
   Later in the evening, I go to Carnegie Hall. I can say little about
the pianist; I even forgot her unfamiliar foreign-sounding name.
All I know is that she studied in some Muscovite conservatory. But
I can expect to get some music out of the piano. It will be rare to
have someone who performed brilliantly enough in the past to get
to Carnegie Hall and now turns out to have benefited from luck
alone. The expectation of having a fraud who will bang on the
piano, producing only cacophonous sounds, is indeed low enough
for me to rule it out completely.
   I was in London last Saturday. Saturdays in London are magical;
bustling but without the mechanical industry of a weekday or the
sad resignation of a Sunday. Without a wristwatch or a plan I
found myself in front of my favorite carvings by Canova at the
Victoria and Albert Museum. My professional bent immediately
made me question whether randomness played a large role in the
carving of these marble statues. The bodies were realistic repro­
ductions of human figures, except that they were more harmo­
nious and finely balanced than anything I have seen mother nature
produce on its own (Ovid's materiam superabat opus comes to
mind) . Could such finesse be a product of luck?
   I can practically make the same statement about anyone oper­
ating in the physical world, or in a business in which the degree of
randomness is low. But there is a problem in anything related to
the business world. I am bothered because tomorrow, unfortu­
nately, I have an appointment with a fund manager seeking my
help, and that of my friends, in finding investors. He has what he
claims is a good track record. All I can infer is that he has learned to
buy and sell. And it is harder to fry an egg than buy and sell.
Well . . .the fact that he made money in the past may have some
relevance, but not terribly so. This is not to say that it is always the
case; there are some instances in which one can trust a track
    I T I S EA S I ER T O B U Y A N D S E L L T I-I A N � R Y A N EG G   1 51


record, but, alas, there are not too many of these. As the reader
now knows, the fund manager can expect to be heckled by me
during the presentation, particularly if he does not exhibit the
minimum of humility and self-doubt that I would expect from
someone practicing randomness. I will probably bombard him
with questions that he may not be prepared to answer, blinded by
his past results. I will probably lecture him that Machiavelli as­
cribed to luck at least a 50% role in life (the rest was cunning and
bravura) , and that was before the creation of modern markets.
   In this chapter, I discuss some well-known counterintuitive
properties of performance records and historical time series. The
concept presented here is well-known for some of its variations
under the names suroivorship bias, data mining, data snooping, over­
fitting, regression to the mean, etc., basically situations where the
performance is exaggerated by the observer, owing to a misper­
ception of the importance of randomness.Clearly, this concept has
rather unsettling implications. It extends to more general situa­
tions where randomness may play a share, such as the choice of a
medical treatment or the interpretation of coincidental events.
    When I am tempted to suggest a possible future contribution of
financial research to science in general, I adduce the analysis of
data mining and the study of survivorship biases. These have been
refined in finance but can extend to all areas of scientific investi­
gation.\,Yhy is finance so rich a field? Because it is one of the rare
areas of investigation where we have plenty of information (in the
form of abundant price series) , but no ability to conduct experi­
ments as in, say, physics. This dependence on past data brings
about its salient defects.

                             Placebo Investors
I have often been faced with questions of the sort: "Who do you
think you are to tell me that I might have been plain lucky in my
                 152   M O N K E Y S O N T Y PE W R I TERS


life?" Well, nobody really believes that he or she was lucky.My ap­
proach is that, with our Monte Carlo engine, we can manufacture
purely random situations. We can do the exact opposite of con­
ventional methods; in place of analyzing real people hunting for
attributes we can create artificial ones with precisely known at­
tributes.Thus we can manufacture situations that depend on pure,
unadulterated luck, without the shadow of skills or whatever we
have called nonluck in Table P.l . In other words, we can man­
make pure nobodies to laugh at; they will be by design stripped of
any shadow of ability (exactly like a placebo drug).
    We saw in Chapter 5 how people may survive owing to traits
that momentarily fit the given structure of randomness. Here we
take a far simpler situation where we know the strncture of ran­
domness; the first such exercise is a finessing of the old popular
saying that even a broken clock is right twice a day.We will take it a
bit further to show that statistics is a knife that cuts on both sides.
Let us use the Monte Carlo generator introduced earlier and con­
struct a population of l 0,000 fictional investment managers (the
generator is not terribly necessary since we can use a coin, or even
do plain algebra, but it is considerably more illustrative-and fun).
Assume that they each have a perfectly fair game; each one has a
50% probability of making $10,000 at the end of the year, and a
50% probability of losing $ 10,000. Let us introduce an additional
restriction; once a manager has a single bad year, he is thrown out
of the sample, good-bye and have a nice life.Thus we will operate
like the legendary speculator George Soros who was said to tell his
managers gathered in a room: "Half of you guys will be out by next
year" (with an Eastern European accent). Like Soros, we have ex­
tremely high standards; we are looking only for managers with an
unblemished record. We have no patience for low performers.
    The Monte Carlo generator will toss a coin; heads and the man­
ager will make $ 10,000 over the year, tails and he will lose
$10,000. We run it for the first year. At the end of the year, we ex-
    I T I S EA S I ER T O B U Y A N D S E L L T I-I A N l=RY A N EG G   1 53


pect 5, 000 managers to be up $ 10,000 each, and 5 , 000 to be
down $ 10,000. Now we run the game a second year. Again, we
can expect 2, 500 managers to be up two years in a row; another
year, 1, 2 5 0; a fourth one, 625; a fifth, 3 13 .We have now, simply in
a fair game, 3 13 managers who made money for five years in a
row. Out of pure luck.
   Meanwhile if we throw one of these successful traders into the
real world we would get very interesting and helpful comments on
his remarkable style, his incisive mind, and the influences that
helped him achieve such success. Some analysts may attribute his
achievement to precise elements among his childhood experi­
ences. His biographer will dwell on the wonderful role models
provided by his parents; we would be supplied with black-and­
white pictures in the middle of the book of a great mind in the
making.And the following year, should he stop outperforming (re­
call that his odds of having a good year have stayed at 50%) they
would start laying blame, finding fault with the relaxation in his
work ethics, or his dissipated lifestyle.They will find something he
did before when he was successful that he has subsequently
stopped doing, and attribute his failure to that. The truth will be,
however, that he simply ran out of luck.

                    Nobody Has to Be Competent
Let's push the argument further to make it more interesting.We
create a cohort that is composed exclusively of incompetent man­
agers. We will define an incompetent manager as someone who
has a negative expected return, the equivalent of the odds being
stacked against him.We instruct the Monte Carlo generator now
to draw from an urn. The urn has 100 balls, 45 black and 5 5 red.
By drawing with replacement, the ratio of red to black balls will
remain the same. If we draw a black ball, the manager will earn
$ 10,000. If we draw a red ball, he will lose $ 10,000.The manager
is thus expected to earn $ 10, 000 with 4 5 % probability, and lose
                 154   M O N K i. v s O N T V PE, W R I T !, R S


$ 10,000 with 5 5 % . On average, the manager will lose $1,000 each
round-but only on average.
   At the end of the first year, we still expect to have 4, 500 man­
agers turning a profit (4 5% of them) , the second, 4 5 % of that
number, 2,025 . The third, 9 11; the fourth, 4 10; the fifth, 184 . Let
us give the surviving managers names and dress them in business
suits.True, they represent less than 2% of the original cohort. But
they will get attention. Nobody will mention the other 98%.What
can we conclude?
   The first counterintuitive point is that a population entirely
composed of bad managers will produce a small amount of great
track records. As a matter of fact, assuming the manager shows
up unsolicited at your door, it will be practically impossible to
figure out whether he is good or bad. The results would not
markedly change even if the population were composed entirely
of managers who are expected in the long run to lose money.
Why? Because owing to volatility, some of them will make
money. We can see here that volatility actually helps bad invest­
ment decisions.
   The second counterintuitive point is that the expectation of the
maximum of track records, with which we are concerned, depends
more on the size of the initial sample than on the individual odds
per manager. In other words, the number of managers with great
track records in a given market depends far more on the number
of people who started in the investment business (in place of
going to dental school) , rather than on their ability to produce
profits. It also depends on the volatility. Why do I use the notion of
expectation of the maximum? Because I am not concerned at all
with the average track record. I will get to see only the best of the
managers, not all of the managers. This means that we would see
more "excellent managers " in 2006 than in 1998, provided the co­
hort of beginners was greater in 200 l than it was in 1993-1 can
safely say that it was.

                         Regression to the Mean
The "hot hand in basketball" is another example of misperception
of random sequences: It is very likely in a large sample of players
for one of them to have an inordinately lengthy lucky streak.As a
matter of fact it is very unlikely that an unspecified player some­
where does not have an inordinately lengthy lucky streak.This is a
manifestation of the mechanism called regression to the mean. I
can explain it as follows:
   Generate a long series of coin flips producing heads and tails
with 50% odds each and fill up sheets of paper.If the series is long
enough you may get eight heads or eight tails in a row, perhaps
even ten of each.Yet you know that in spite of these wins the con­
ditional odds of getting a head or a tail is still 50%. Imagine these
heads and tails as monetary bets filling up the coffers of an indi­
vidual.The deviation from the norm as seen in excess heads or ex­
cess tails is here entirely attributable to luck, in other words, to
variance, not to the skills of the hypothetical player (since there is
an even probability of getting either) .
   A result is that in real life, the larger the deviation from the
norm, the larger the probability of it coming from luck rather
than skills: Consider that even if one has 5 5 % probability of
heads, the odds of ten wins is still very small. This can be easily
verified in stories of very prominent people in trading rapidly re­
verting to obscurity, like the heroes I used to watch in trading
rooms.This applies to height of individuals or the size of dogs.In
the latter case, consider that two average-sized parents produce
a large litter.The largest dogs, if they diverge too much from the
average, will tend to produce offspring of smaller size than them­
selves, and vice versa. This "reversion" for the large outliers is
what has been observed in history and explained as regression to
the mean.Note that the larger the deviation, the more important
its effect.
                156   M O N K l: Y S O N T Y P l: W R I T l: R S


   Again, one word of warning: All deviations do not come from
this effect, but a disproportionately large proportion of them do.

                               Ergo dicity
To get more technical, I have to say that people believe that they
can figure out the properties of the distribution from the sample
they are witnessing.When it comes to matters that depend on the
maximum, it is altogether another distribution that is being in­
ferred, that of the best performers.We call the difference between
the average of such distribution and the unconditional distribu­
tion of winners and losers the survivorship bias-here the fact that
about 3% of the initial cohort discussed earlier will make money
five years in a row.In addition, this example illustrates the proper­
ties of ergodicity, namely, that time will eliminate the annoying ef­
fects of randomness. Looking forward, in spite of the fact that
these managers were profitable in the past five years, we expect
them to break even in any future time period. They will fare no
better than those of the initial cohort who failed earlier in the ex­
ercise.Ah, the long term.
   A few years ago, when I told one A., a then Master-of-the­
Universe type, that track records were less relevant than he
thought, he found the remark so offensive that he violently flung
his cigarette lighter in my direction.The episode taught me a lot.
Remember that nobody accepts randomness in his own success,
only his failure. His ego was pumped up as he was heading up a
department of "great traders " who were then temporarily making
a fortune in the markets and attributing the idea to the soundness
of their business, their insights, or their intelligence. They subse­
quently blew up during the harsh New York winter of 1994 (it
was the bond market crash that followed the surprise interest rate
hike by Alan Greenspan).The interesting part is that several years
later I can hardly find any of them still trading (ergodicity).
   Recall that the survivorship bias depends on the size of the ini-
    I T I S EA S I ER T O B U Y A N D S E L L T H A N F R Y A N EG G   157


tial population.The information that a person derived some prof­
its in the past, just by itself, is neither meaningful nor relevant.We
need to know the size of the population from which he came. In
other words, without knowing how many managers out there have
tried and failed, we will not be able to assess the validity of the
track record.If the initial population includes ten managers, then
I would give the performer half my savings without a blink. If the
initial population is composed of 10,000 managers, I would ignore
the results.The latter situation is generally the case; these days so
many people have been drawn to the financial markets. Many col­
lege graduates are trading as a first career, failing, then going to
dental school.
   If, as in a fairy tale, these fictional managers materialized into
real human beings, one of these could be the person I am meeting
tomorrow at 11:45 a.m. Why did I select 11:45 a.m.? Because I
will question him about his trading style. I need to know how he
trades. I will then be able to claim that I have to rush to a lunch
appointment if the manager puts too much emphasis on his track
record.

Next, we look at the extensions to real life of our bias in the un­
derstanding of the distribution of coincidences.

                         The Mysterious Letter
You get an anonymous letter on January 2 informing you that the
market will go up during the month. lt proves to be true, but you
disregard it owing to the well-known January effect (stocks have
gone up historically during January) . Then you receive another
one on February 1 telling you that the market will go down.Again,
it proves to be true. Then you get another ietter on March 1-
same story. By July you are intrigued by the prescience of the
                 1 58   M O N K E Y S O N T Y PEWRI TERS


anonymous person and you are asked to invest in a special off­
shore fund. You pour all your savings into it. Two months later,
your money is gone. You go spill your tears on your neighbor's
shoulder and he tells you that he remembers that he received two
such mysterious letters. But the mailings stopped at the second
letter.He recalls that the first one was correct in its prediction, the
other incorrect.
   What happened? The trick is as follows. The con operator
pulls 10 ,000 names out of a phone book. He mails a bullish let­
ter to one half of the sample, and a bearish one to the other half
The following month he selects the names of the persons to
whom he mailed the letter whose prediction turned out to be
right, that is, 5 , 000 names. The next month he does the same
with the remaining 2, 500 names, until the list narrows down to
500 people. Of these there will be 200 victims.An investment in
a few thousand dollars' worth of postage stamps will turn into
several million.

                   An Interrupted Tennis Game
It is not uncommon for someone watching a tennis game on tele­
vision to be bombarded by advertisements for funds that did
(until that minute) outperform others by some percentage over
some period. But, again, why would anybody advertise if he didn't
happen to outperform the market? There is a high probability of
the investment coming to you if its success is caused entirely by
randomness. This phenomenon is what economists and insurance
people call adverse selection.Judging an investment that comes to
you requires more stringent standards than judging an investment
you seek, owing to such selection bias. For example, by going to a
cohort composed of 10,000 managers, I have 2/100 chances of
finding a spurious survivor. By staying home and answering my
doorbell, the chance of the soliciting party being a spurious sur­
vivor is closer to 100% .
    I T I S EA S I ER T O B U Y A N D S E L L T M A N F R Y A N E G G   159




                            Reverse Survivors
We have so far discussed the spurious survivor-the same logic
applies to the skilled person who has the odds markedly stacked in
her favor, but who still ends up going to the cemetery. This effect
is the exact opposite of the survivorship bias. Consider that all one
needs is two bad years in the investment industry to terminate a
risk-taking career and that, even with great odds in one's favor,
such an outcome is very possible.What do people do to survive?
They maximize their odds of staying in the game by taking black­
swan risks (like John and Carlos)-those that fare well most of the
time, but incur a risk of blowing up.

                         The Birthday Paradox
The most intuitive way to describe the data mining problem to a
nonstatistician is through what is called the birthday paradox,
though it is not really a paradox, simply a perceptional oddity. If
you meet someone randomly, there is a one in 3 6 5 .2 5 chance of
your sharing their birthday, and a considerably smaller one of hav­
ing the exact birthday of the same year. So, sharing the same birth­
day would be a coincidental event that you would discuss at the
dinner table. Now let us look at a situation where there are 2 3
people in a room.What i s the chance of there being 2 people with
the same birthday? About 50%. For we are not specifying which
people need to share a birthday; any pair works.

                           It's a Small World!
A similar misconception of probabilities arises from the random
encounters one may have with relatives or friends in highly unex­
pected places. "It's a small world! " is often uttered with surprise.
But these are not improbable occurrences-the world is much
larger than we think. It is just that we are not truly testing for the
odds of having an encounter with one specific person, in a specific
                1 60   M O N K E: Y S O N T Y P E: W R I T E: R S


location at a specific time.Rather, we are simply testing for any en­
counter, with any person we have ever met in the past, and in any
place we will visit during the period concerned. The probability of
the latter is considerably higher, perhaps several thousand times
the magnitude of the former.
   When the statistician looks at the data to test a given relation­
ship, say, to ferret out the correlation between the occurrence of a
given event, like a political announcement, and stock market
volatility, odds are that the results can be taken seriously. But
when one throws the computer at data, looking for just about any
relationship, it is certain that a spurious connection will emerge,
such as the fate of the stock market being linked to the length of
women's skirts. And just like the birthday coincidences, it will
amaze people.

           Data Mining, Statistics, and Charlatanism
What is your probability of winning the New Jersey lottery twice?
One in 17 trillion. Yet it happened to Evelyn Adams, whom the
reader might guess should feel particularly chosen by destiny.
Using the method we developed above, researchers Percy Diaco­
nis and Frederick Mosteller estimated at 30 to l the probability
that someone, somewhere, in a totally unspecified way, gets so
lucki
    Some people carry their data mining activities into theology­
after all, ancient Mediterraneans used to read potent messages in
the entrails of birds.An interesting extension of data mining into
biblical exegesis is provided in The Bible Code by Michael Dros­
nin.Drosnin, a former journalist (seemingly innocent of any train­
ing in statistics), aided by the works of a "mathematician," helped
"predict" the former Israeli Prime Minister Y itzhak Rabin's assassi­
nation by deciphering a bible code. He informed Rabin, who ob­
viously did not take it too seriously.The Bible Code finds statistical
irregularities in the Bible; these help predict some such events.
    I T I S EA S I ER T O B U Y A N D S E L L T H A N F R Y A N EG G   161


Needless to say that the book sold well enough to warrant a sequel
predicting with hindsight even more such events.
   The same mechanism is behind the formation of conspiracy
theories. Like The Bible Code they can seem perfect in their logic
and can cause otherwise intelligent people to fall for them. I can
create a conspiracy theory by downloading hundreds of paintings
from an artist or group of artists and finding a constant among all
those paintings (among the hundreds of thousand of traits). I
would then concoct a conspiratorial theory around a secret mes­
sage shared by these paintings. This is seemingly what the author
of the bestselling The Da Vinci Code did.

                 The Best Book I Have Ever Read!
My favorite time is spent in bookstores, where I aimlessly move
from book to book in an attempt to make a decision as to whether
to invest the time in reading it. My buying is frequently made on
impulse, based on superficial but suggestive clues. Frequently, I
have nothing but a book jacket as appendage to my decision mak­
ing.Jackets often contain praise by someone, famous or not, or ex­
cerpts from a book review. Good praise by a famous and respected
person or a well-known magazine would sway me into buying the
book.
   What is the problem? I tend to confuse a book review, which is
supposed to be an assessment of the quality of the book, with the
best book reviews, marred with the same survivorship biases.I mis­
take the distribution of the maximum of a variable with that of
the variable itself The publisher will never put on the jacket of the
book anything but the best praise. Some authors go even a step be­
yond, taking a tepid or even unfavorable book review and select­
ing words in it that appear to praise the book. One such example
came from one Paul Wilmott (an English financial mathematician
of rare brilliance and irreverence) who managed to announce that
I gave him his "first bad review, " yet used excerpts from it as praise
                162   M O N KEY S O N T Y PEW R I T ER S


on the book jacket (we later became friends, which allowed me to
extract an endorsement from him for this book).
   The first time I was fooled by this bias was upon buying, when
I was sixteen, Manhattan Transfer, a book by John Dos Passos, the
American writer, based on praise on the jacket by the French
writer and "philosopher" Jean-Paul Sartre, who claimed something
to the effect that Dos Passos was the greatest writer of our time.
This simple remark, possibly blurted out in a state of intoxication
or extreme enthusiasm, caused Dos Passos to become required
reading in European intellectual circles, as Sartre's remark was
mistaken for a consensus estimate of the quality of Dos Passos
rather than what it was, the best remark.(In spite of such interest
in his work, Dos Passos has reverted to obscurity.)

                           The Backtester
A programmer helped me build a backtester. It is a software program
connected to a database of historical prices, which allows me to
check the hypothetical past performance of any trading rule of av­
erage complexity. I can just apply a mechanical trading rule, like buy
NASDAQ stocks if they close more than 1.83 % above their average
of the previous week, and immediately get an idea of its past per­
formance.The screen will flash my hypothetical track record associ­
ated with the trading rule.If I do not like the results, I can change
the percentage to, say, 1.2%.I can also make the rule more complex.
I will keep trying until I find something that works well.
   What am I doing? The exact same task of looking for the sur­
vivor within the set of rules that can possibly work.I am fitting the
rule on the data.This activity is called data snooping. The more I
try, the more I am likely, by mere luck, to find a rule that worked
on past data.A random series will always present some detectable
pattern. I am convinced that there exists a tradable security in the
Western world that would be 100% correlated with the changes in
temperature in Ulan Bator, Mongolia.
    I T I S EA S I ER T O B U Y A N D S E L L T I-I A N l= R Y A N E G G   1 63


   To get technical, there are even worse extensions.An outstand­
ing recent paper by Sullivan, Timmerman, and White goes further
and considers that the rules that may be in use successfully today
may be the result of a survivorship bias.


   Suppose that, over time, investors have experimented with
  technical trading rules drawn from a very wide universe-in
  principle thousands of parameterizations of a variety of types of
  rules.As time progresses, the rules that'happen to perform well
  historically receive more attention and are considered "serious
  contenders" by the investment community, while unsuccessful
  trading rules are more likely to be forgotten ... . If enough tra d­
  ing rules are considered over time, some rules are bound by
  pure luck, even in a very large sample, to produce superior per­
  formance even if they do not genuinely possess predictive
  power over asset returns.Of course, inference based solely on
  the subset of surviving trading rules may be misleading in this
  context since it does not account for the full set of initial trad­
  ing rules, most of which are unlikely to have underperformed.

   I have to decry some excesses in backtesting that I have closely
witnessed in my private career. There is an excellent product de­
signed j ust for that, called Omega TradeStation, that is currently
on the market, in use by tens of thousands of traders.It even offers
its own computer language.Beset with insomnia, the computer­
ized day traders become night testers plowing the data for some of
its properties. By dint of throwing their monkeys on typewriters,
without specifying what book they want their monkey to write,
they will hit upon hypothetical gold somewhere. Many of them
blindly believe in it.
    One of my colleagues, a man with prestigious degrees, grew to
believe in such a virtual world to the point of losing all sense of re­
ality. Whether the modicum of common sense left in him might
                164   M O N K !; Y S O N T Y P !; W R I T !; R S


have rapidly vanished under the mounds of simulations, or whether
he might have had none to engage in such pursuit, I cannot tell. By
closely watching him I learned that what natural skepticism he may
have had vanished under the weight of data-for he was extremely
skeptical, but in the wrong area.Ah, Hume!

                  A More Unsettling Extension
Historically, medicine has operated by trial and error-in other
words, statistically.We know by now that there can be entirely for­
tuitous connections between symptoms and treatment, and that
some medications succeed in medical trials for mere random rea­
sons. I cannot claim expertise in medicine, but have been a steady
reader of a segment of the medical literature over the past half
decade, long enough to be concerned with the standards, as we
will see in the next chapter. Medical researchers are rarely statisti­
cians; statisticians are rarely medical researchers.Many medical re­
searchers are not even remotely aware of this data mining bias.
True, it may only play a small role, but it is certainly present. One
recent medical study links cigarette smoking to a reduction in
breast cancer, thus conflicting with all previous studies. Logic
would indicate that the result may be suspicious, the result of
mere coincidence.

           The Earnings Season: Fooled by the Results
Wall Street analysts, in general, are trained to find the accounting
tricks that companies use to hide their earnings.They tend to (oc­
casionally) beat the companies at that game. But they are neither
trained to reflect nor to deal with randomness (nor to understand
the limitations of their methods by introspecting-stock analysts
have both a worse record and higher idea of their past perform­
ance than weather forecasters) . When a company shows an in­
crease in earnings once, it draws no immediate attention.Twice,
and the name starts showing up on computer screens.Three times,
and the company will merit some buy recommendation.
    I T I S EA S I ER T O B U Y A N D S E L L T I-I A N l=RY A N EG G   165


  Just a s with the track record problem, consider a cohort of
10, 000 companies that are assumed on average to barely return
the risk-free rate (i.e., Treasury bonds) .They engage in all forms of
volatile business. At the end of the first year, we will have 5 , 000
"star" companies showing an increase in profits ( assuming no infla­
tion) , and 5, 000 "dogs." After three years, we will have 1, 250
"stars." The stock review committee at the investment house will
give your broker their names as "strong buys." He will leave a voice
message that he has a hot recommendation that necessitates im­
mediate action.You will be e-mailed a long list of names.You will
buy one or two of them. Meanwhile, the manager in charge of
your 401(k) retirement plan will be acquiring the entire list.
  We can apply the reasoning to the selection of investment cate­
gories-as if they were the managers in the example above. As­
sume you are standing in 1900 with hundreds of investments to
look at. There are the stock markets of Argentina, Imperial Russia,
the United Kingdom, Unified Germany, and plenty of others to
consider.A rational person would have bought not just the emerg­
ing country of the United States, but those of Russia and Argentina
as well. The rest of the story is well-known; while many of the
stock markets like those of the United Kingdom and the United
States fared extremely well, the investor in Imperial Russia would
have no better than medium-quality wallpaper in his hands. The
countries that fared well are not a large segment of the initial co­
hort; randomness would be expected to allow a few investment
classes to fare extremely well. I wonder if those "experts" who
make foolish (and self-serving) statements like "markets will always
go up in any twenty-year period" are aware of this problem.


                      C O M PARATI V E L U C K

A far more acute problem relates to the outperformance, or the
comparison, between two or more persons or entities.While we
are certainly fooled by randomness when it comes to a single times
                166   M O N K EY S O N T Y PE W R I T ER S


series, the foolishness is compounded when it comes to the com­
parison between, say, two people, or a person and a benchmark.
Why? Because both are random. Let us do the following simple
thought experiment. Take two individuals, say, a person and his
brother-in-law, launched through life.Assume equal odds for each
of good and bad luck. Outcomes: lucky-lucky (no difference be­
tween them) , unlucky-unlucky (again, no difference) , lucky­
unlucky (a large difference between them), unlucky-lucky (again,
a large difference) .
   I recently attended for the first time a conference of investment
managers where I sat listening to a very dull presenter comparing
traders. His profession is to select fund managers and package
them together for investors, something called "funds of funds" and
I was listening to him as he was pouring out numbers on the
screen. The first revelation was that I suddenly recognized the
speaker, a former colleague biologically transformed by the pas­
sage of time. He used to be crisp, energetic, and nice; he became
dull, portly, and inordinately comfortable with success. (He was
not rich when I knew him-can people react to money in differ­
ent ways? Do some take themselves seriously while others do
not?) T he second revelation was that while I suspected that he was
fooled by randomness, the extent had to be far greater than one
could imagine, particularly with the survivorship bias. A back of
the envelope calculation showed that at least 97% of what he was
discussing was just noise. T he fact that he was comparing perform­
ances made the matter far worse.

                           Cancer Cures
When I return home from an Asian or European trip, my jet lag
often causes me to rise at a very early hour. Occasionally, though
very rarely, I switch on the TV set searching for market informa­
tion.What strikes me in these morning explorations is the abun­
dance of claims by the alternative medicine vendors of the curing
    I T I S EA S I ER T O B U Y A N D S E L L T H A N l=RY A N E G G   167


power of their products. These no doubt are caused by the lower
advertising rates at that time. To prove their claim, they present
the convincing testimonial of someone who was cured thanks to
their methods. For instance, I once saw a former throat cancer pa­
tient explaining how he was saved by a combination of vitamins
for sale for the exceptionally low price of $ 14.95-in all likeli­
hood he was sincere (although of course compensated for his ac­
count, perhaps with a lifetime supply of such medicine) . In spite
of our advances, people still believe in the existence of links be­
tween disease and cure based on such information, and there is no
scientific evidence that can convince them more potently than a
sincere and emotional testimonial. Such testimonial does not al­
ways come from the regular guy; statements by Nobel Prize win­
ners (in the wrong discipline) could easily suffice. Linus Pauling, a
Nobel Prize winner in chemistry, was said to believe in vitamin C's
medicinal properties, himself ingesting massive daily doses. With
his bully pulpit, he contributed to the common belief in vitamin
C's curative properties. Many medical studies, unable to replicate
Pauling's claims, fell on deaf ears as it was difficult to undo the tes­
timonial by a "Nobel Prize winner," even if he was not qualified to
discuss matters related to medicine.
   Many of these claims have been harmless outside of the finan­
cial profits for these charlatans-but many cancer patients may
have replaced the more scientifically investigated therapies, in
favor of these methods, and died as a result of their neglecting
more orthodox cures (again, the nonscientific methods are gath­
ered under what is called "alternative medicine," that is, unproven
therapies, and the medical community has difficulties convincing
the press that there is only one medicine and that alternative med­
icine is not medicine) .The reader might wonder about my claims
that the user of these products could be sincere, without it mean­
ing that he was cured by the illusory treatment. The reason is
something called "spontaneous remission," in which a very small
                 168   M O N K EY S O N T Y PE W R I TER S


minority of cancer patients, for reasons that remain entirely spec­
ulative, wipe out cancer cells and recover "miraculously." Some
switch causes the patient's immune system to eradicate all cancer
cells from the body. These people would have been equally cured
by drinking a glass of Vermont spring water or chewing on dried
beef as they were by taking these beautifully wrapped pills. Fi­
nally, these spontaneous remissions might not be so spontaneous;
they might, at the bottom, have a cause that we are not yet so­
phisticated enough to detect.
    The late astronomer Carl Sagan, a devoted promoter of scien­
tific thinking and an obsessive enemy of nonscience, examined the
cures from cancer that resulted from a visit to Lourdes in France,
where people were healed by simple contact with the holy waters,
and found out the interesting fact that, of the total cancer patients
who visited the place, the cure; rate was, if anything, lower than
the statistical one for spontaneous remissions. It was lower than
the average for those who did not go to Lourdes] Should a statis­
tician infer here that cancer patients' odds of surviving deterio­
rates after a visit to Lourdes?

       Professor Pearson Goes to Monte Carlo (Literally) :
             Randomness Does Not Look Random!
At the beginning of the twentieth century, as we were starting to
develop techniques to deal with the notion of random outcomes,
several methods were designed to detect anomalies. Professor Karl
Pearson (father of Egon Pearson of Neyman-Pearson fame, famil­
iar to every person who sat in a statistics 1 0 1 class) devised the
first test of nonrandomness (it was in reality a test of deviation
from normality, which, for all intents and purposes, was the same
thing) . He examined millions of runs of what was called a Monte
Carlo (the old name for a roulette wheel) during the month of
July 1902. He discovered that, with a high degree of statistical sig­
nificance (with an error of less than one to a billion) , the runs were
    I T I S EAS I ER T O B U Y A N D S E L L T H A N FRY A N EG G   169


not purely random. What) The roulette wheel was not random)
Professor Pearson was greatly surprised at the discovery. But this
result in itself tells us nothing; we know that there is no such thing
as a pure random draw, for the outcome of the draw depends on
the quality of the equipment. With enough minutiae one would
be able to uncover the nonrandomness somewhere (e.g., the
wheel itself may not have been perfectly balanced or perhaps the
spinning ball was not completely spherical) . Philosophers of sta­
tistics call this the reference case problem to explain that there is no
true attainable randomness in practice, only in theory. Besides, a
manager would question whether such nonrandomness can lead
to any meaningful, profitable rules. If I need to gamble $ 1 on
l 0,000 runs and expect to make $1 for my efforts, then I would do
much better in the part-time employment of a janitorial agency.
  But the result bears another suspicious element. Of more prac­
tical relevance here is the following severe problem about nonran­
domness. Even the fathers of statistical science forgot that a
random series of runs need not exhibit a pattern to look random;
as a matter of fact, data that is perfectly patternless would be ex­
tremely suspicious and appear to be man-made.A single random
run is bound to exhibit some pattern-if one looks hard enough.
Note that Professor Pearson was among the first scholars who
were interested in creating artificial random data generators, tables
one could use as inputs for various scientific and engineering sim­
ulations (the precursors of our Monte Carlo simulator) .The prob­
lem is that they did not want these tables to exhibit any form of
regularity.Yet real randomness does not look random�
    I would further illustrate the point with the study of a phe­
nomenon well-known as cancer clusters. Consider a square with
16 random darts hitting it with equal probability of being at any
place in the square.If we divide the square into 16 smaller squares,
it is expected that each smaller square will contain one dart on av­
erage-but only on average. There is a very small probability of
                170   M O N K E Y S O N T Y PEWRI T ERS


having exactly 16 darts in 16 different squares. The average grid
will have more than one dart in a few squares, and no dart at all in
many squares. It will be an exceptionally rare incident that no
(cancer) cluster would show on the grid.Now, transpose our grid
with the darts in it to overlay a map of any region. Some newspa­
per will declare that one of the areas (the one with more than the
average of darts) harbors radiation that causes cancer, prompting
lawyers to start soliciting the patients.

             The Dog That D id Not Bark: On B iases
                    in Scientific Knowledge
By the same argument, science is marred by a pernicious survivor­
ship bias, affecting the way research gets published. In a way that
is similar to journalism, research that yields no result does not
make it to print. That may seem sensible, as newspapers do not
have to have a screaming headline saying that nothing new is tak­
ing place (though the Bible was smart enough to declare ein
chadash tachat hashemesh-"nothing new under the sun, " provid­
ing the information that things just do recur) .The problem is that
a finding of absence and an absence of findings get mixed together.
T here may be great information in the fact that nothing took place.
As Sherlock Holmes noted in the Silver Blaze case-the curious
thing was that the dog did not bark. More problematic, there are
plenty of scientific results that are left out of publications because
they are not statistically significant, but nevertheless provide in­
formation.

I am frequently asked the question "When is it truly not luck?"
There are professions in randomness for which performance is low
in luck, like casinos, which manage to tame randomness. In fi­
nance? Perhaps. All traders are not speculative traders: There ex-
    I T I S EA S I ER T O B U Y A N D S E L L T H A N F R Y A N EG G   1 71


ists a segment called market makers whose job is to derive, like
bookmakers, or even like store owners, an income against a trans­
action. If they speculate, their dependence on the risks of such
speculation remains too small compared to their overall volume.
They buy at a price and sell to the public at a more favorable one,
performing large numbers of transactions. Such income provides
them some insulation from randomness. Such category includes
floor traders on the exchanges, bank traders who "trade against
order flow," money changers in the souks of the Levant. The skills
involved are sometimes rare to find: Fast thinking, alertness, a high
level of energy, an ability to guess from the voice of the seller her
level of nervousness; those who have them make a long career
(that is, perhaps a decade) . They never make it big, as their income
is constrained by the number of customers, but they do well prob­
abilistically. They are, in a way, the dentists of the profession.
    Outside of this very specialized bookmaker-style profession, to
be honest, I am unable to answer the question of who's lucky or
unlucky. I can tell that person A seems less lucky than person B,
but the confidence in such knowledge can be so weak as to be
meaningless. I prefer to remain a skeptic. People frequently misin­
terpret my opinion. I never said that every rich man is an idiot and
every unsuccessful person unlucky, only that in absence of much
additional information it is preferable to reserve one's judgment.
It is safer.

in life can translate into a highly disproportionate payoff, or, more
viciously, how no advantage at all, but a very, very small help from
randomness, can lead to a bonanza.

First we define nonlinearity. There are many ways to present it, but
one of the most popular ones in science is what is called the sand-
                      L O S E R TA K E S A L L   1 73


pile effect, which I can illustrate as follows. I am currently sitting
on a beach in Copacabana, in Rio de Janeiro, attempting to do
nothing strenuous, away from anything to read and write (un­
successfully, of course, as I am mentally writing these lines) . I am
playing with plastic beach toys borrowed from a child , trying to
build an edifice-modestly but doggedly attempting to emulate
the Tower of Babel. I continuously add sand to the top, slowly
raising the entire structure. My Babylonian relatives thought they
could thus reach the heavens. I have more humble designs­
to test how high I can go before it topples. I keep adding sand,
testing to see how the structure will ultimately collapse. Unused
to seeing adults build sandcastles, a child looks at me with
amazement.
   In time-and much to the onlooking child's delight-my castle
inevitably topples to rejoin the rest of the sand on the beach. It
could be said that the last grain of sand is responsible for the de­
struction of the entire structure.What we are witnessing here is a
nonlinear effect resulting from a linear force exerted on an object .
A very small additional input, here the grain of sand, caused a dis­
proportionate result, namely the destruction of my starter Tower
of Babel. Popular wisdom has integrated many such phenomena,
as witnessed by such expressions as "the straw that broke the
camel's back " or "the drop that caused the water to spill."
   T hese nonlinear dynamics have a bookstore name, "chaos the­
ory, " which is a misnomer because it has nothing to do with chaos.
Chaos theory concerns itself primarily with functions in which a
small input can lead to a disproportionate response. Population
models, for instance, can lead to a path of explosive growth, or ex­
tinction of a species, depending on a very small difference in the
population at a starting point in time. Another popular scientific
analogy is the weather, where it has been shown that a simple but­
terfly fluttering its wings in India can cause a hurricane in New
York. But the classics have their share to offer as well: Pascal (he of
                 174   MONKEYS ON TYPEWRITERS


the wager in Chapter 7) said that if Cleopatra's nose had been
slightly shorter, the world's fate would have changed. Cleopatra
had comely features dominated by a thin and elongated nose that
made Julius Caesar and his successor, Marc Antony, fall for her
(here the intellectual snob in me cannot resist dissenting against
conventional wisdom; Plutarch claimed that it was Cleopatra's
skills in conversation, rather than her good looks, that caused the
maddening infatuation of the shakers and movers of her day; I
truly believe it).

                         Enter Randomness
Things can become more interesting when randomness enters the
game. Imagine a waiting room full of actors queuing for an audi­
tion. The number of actors who will win is clearly small, and they
are the ones generally observed by the public as representative of
the profession, as we saw in our discussion on survivorship bias.
The winners would move into Bel Air, feel pressure to acquire
some basic training in the consumption of luxury goods, and, per­
haps owing to the dissolute and unrhythmic lifestyle, flirt with sub­
stance abuse.As to the others (the great majority), we can imagine
their fate; a lifetime of serving foamed caffe latte at the neighboring
Starbucks, fighting the biological clock between auditions.
   One may argue that the actor who lands the lead role that cat­
apults him into fame and expensive swimming pools has some
skills others lack, some charm, or a specific physical trait that is a
perfect match for such a career path. I beg to differ. The winner
may have some acting skills, but so do all of the others, otherwise
they would not be in the waiting room.
   It is an interesting attribute of fame that it has its own dynam­
ics.An actor becomes known by some parts of the public because
he is known by other parts of the public. The dynamics of such
fame follow a rotating helix, which may have started at the audi­
tion, as the selection could have been caused by some silly detail
                      L O S E R TA K E S A L L   1 75


that fitted the mood of the examiner on that day.Had the exam­
iner not fallen in love the previous day with a person with a
similar-sounding last name, then our selected actor from that par­
ticular sample history would be serving caffe latte in the interven­
ing sample history.

                          Learning to Type
Researchers frequently use the example of QWERTY to describe
the vicious dynamics of winning and losing in an economy, and to
illustrate how the final outcome is more than frequently the un­
deserved one.The arrangement of the letters on a typewriter is
an example of the success of the least deserving method. For
our typewriters have the order of the letters on their keyboard
arranged in a nonoptimal manner, as a matter of fact in such a
nonoptimal manner as to slow down the typing rather than make
the job easy, in order to avoid jamming the ribbons as they were
designed for less electronic days.Therefore, as we started building
better typewriters and computerized word processors, several at­
tempts were made to rationalize the computer keyboard, to no
avail. People were trained on a QWERTY keyboard and their
habits were too sticky for change.Just like the helical propulsion
of an actor into stardom, people patronize what other people like
to do.Forcing rational dynamics on the process would be super­
fluous, nay, impossible.This is called a path dependent outcome, and
has thwarted many mathematical attempts at modeling behavior.
   It is obvious that the information age, by homogenizing our
tastes, is causing the unfairness to be even more acute-those who
win capture almost all the customers.The example that strikes
many as the most spectacular lucky success is that of the software
maker Microsoft and its moody founder Bill Gates.While it is hard
to deny that Gates is a man of high personal standards, work ethics,
and above-average intelligence, is he the best? Does he deserve it?
Clearly not. Most people are equipped with his software (like my-
                1 76   M O N K !; V S O N T V P !; W R I T !; R S


self ) because other people are equipped with his software, a purely
circular effect (economists call that "network externalities") . No­
body ever claimed that it was the best software product. Most of
Gates' rivals have an obsessive jealousy of his success. They are
maddened by the fact that he managed to win so big while many
of them are struggling to make their companies survive.
    Such ideas go against classical economic models, in which results
either come from a precise reason (there is no account for uncer­
tainty) or the good guy wins (the good guy is the one who is more
skilled and has some technical superiority) . Economists discovered
path-dependent effects late in their game, then tried to publish
wholesale on the topic that otherwise would be bland and obvious.
For instance, Brian Arthur, an economist concerned with nonlinear­
ities at the Santa Fe Institute, wrote that chance events coupled
with positive feedback rather than technological superiority will de­
termine economic superiority-not some abstrusely defined edge in
a given area of expertise. While early economic models excluded
randomness, Arthur explained how "unexpected orders, chance
meetings with lawyers, managerial whims .. . would help deter­
mine which ones achieved early sales and, over time, which firms
dominated."

                       T H E; IH A L W O R L D

A mathematical approach to the problem is in order. While in
conventional models (such as the well-known Brownian random
walk used in finance) the probability of success does not change
with every incremental step, only the accumulated wealth, Arthur
suggests models such as the Polya process, which is mathemati­
cally very difficult to work with, but can be easily understood with
the aid of a Monte Carlo simulator.The Polya process can be pre­
sented as follows: Assume an urn initially containing equal quanti­
ties of black and red balls.You are to guess each time which color
                      L O S ER TA K E S A L L   177


you will pull out before you make the draw. Here the game is
rigged. Unlike a conventional urn, the probability of guessing cor­
rectly depends on past success, as you get better or worse at guess­
ing depending on past performance. Thus, the probability of
winning increases after past wins, that of losing increases after past
losses. Simulating such a process, one can see a huge variance of
outcomes, with astonishing successes and a large number of fail­
ures (what we called skewness).
   Compare such a process with those that are more commonly
modeled, that is, an urn from which the player makes guesses with
replacement. Say you played roulette and won. Would this in­
crease your chances of winning again? No. In a Polya process case,
it does. Why is this so mathematically hard to work with? Because
the notion of independence (i. e., when the next draw does not de­
pend on past outcomes) is violated. Independence is a require­
ment for working with the (known) math of probability.
   What has gone wrong with the development of economics as a
science? Answer: There was a bunch of intelligent people who felt
compelled to use mathematics just to tell themselves that they were
rigorous in their thinking, that theirs was a science. Someone in a
great rush decided to introduce mathematical modeling techniques
(culprits: Leon Walras, Gerard Debreu, Paul Samuelson) without
considering the fact that either the class of mathematics they were
using was too restrictive for the class of problems they were dealing
with, or that perhaps they should be aware that the precision of the
language of mathematics could lead people to believe that they had
solutions when in fact they had none (recall Popper and the costs of
taking science too seriously). Indeed the mathematics they dealt
with did not work in the real world, possibly because we needed
richer classes of processes-and they refused to accept the fact that
no mathematics at all was probably better.
   The so-called complexity theorists came to the rescue. Much ex­
citement was generated by the works of scientists who specialized
in nonlinear quantitative methods-the mecca of those being the
                 1 78   M O N K EY S O N T Y PE W R I TERS


Santa Fe Institute near Santa Fe, New Mexico. Clearly these scien­
tists are trying hard, and providing us with wonderful solutions in
the physical sciences and better models in the social siblings
(though nothing satisfactory there yet).And if they ultimately do
not succeed, it will simply be because mathematics may be of only
secondary help in our real world. Note another advantage of
Monte Carlo simulations is that we can get results where mathe­
matics fails us and can be of no help. In freeing us from equations
it frees us from the traps of inferior mathematics.As I said in
Chapter 3, mathematics is merely a way of thinking and meditat­
ing, little more, in our world of randomness.

                        The Science of Networks
Studies of the dynamics of networks have mushroomed recently.
They became popular with Malcolm Gladwell's book The Tipping
Point, in which he shows how some of the behaviors of variables
such as epidemics spread extremely fast beyond some unspecified
critical level.(Like, say, the use of sneakers by inner-city kids or the
diffusion of religious ideas.Book sales witness a similar effect, ex­
ploding once they cross a significant level of word-of-mouth.)
Why do some ideologies or religions spread like wildfire while
others become rapidly extinct? How do fads catch fire? How do
idea viruses proliferate? Once one exits the conventional models
of randomness (the bell curve family of charted randomness),
something acute can happen.Why does the Internet hub Google
get so many hits as compared to that of the National Association
of Retired Veteran Chemical Engineers? The more connected a
network, the higher the probability of someone hitting it and the
more connected it will be, especially if there is no meaningful lim­
itation on such capacity. Note that it is sometimes foolish to look
for precise "critical points " as they may be unstable and impossible
to know except, like many things, after the fact.Are these "critical
points" not quite points but progressions (the so-called Pareto
power laws)? While it is clear that the world produces clusters it
                     L O S ER TA K E S A L L   179


is also sad that these may be too difficult to predict (outside of
physics) for us to take their models seriously. Once again the im­
portant fact is knowing the existence of these nonlinearities, not
trying to model them.The value of the great Benoit Mandelbrot's
work lies more in telling us that there is a "wild " type of random­
ness of which we will never know much (owing to their unstable
properties) .

                             Our Brain
Our brain is not cut out for nonlinearities. People think that if,
say, two variables are causally linked, then a steady input in one
variable should always yield a result in the other one. Our emo­
tional apparatus is designed for linear causality.For instance, you
study every day and learn something in proportion to your stud­
ies.If you do not feel that you are going anywhere, your emotions
will cause you to become demoralized. But reality rarely gives us
the privilege of a satisfying linear positive progression: You may
study for a year and learn nothing, then, unless you are disheart­
ened by the empty results and give up, something will come to
you in a flash. My partner Mark Spitznagel summarizes it as fol­
lows: Imagine yourself practicing the piano every day for a long
time, barely being able to perform "Chopsticks, " then suddenly
finding yourself capable of playing Rachmaninov. Owing to this
nonlinearity, people cannot comprehend the nature of the rare
event. This summarizes why there are routes to success that are
nonrandom, but few, very few, people have the mental stamina to
follow them. Those who go the extra mile are rewarded.In my
profession one may own a security that benefits from lower mar­
ket prices, but may not react at all until some critical point.Most
people give up before the rewards.

      Buri dan's Donkey or the Good Side of Randomness
Nonlinearity in random outcomes is sometimes used as a tool to
break stalemates. Consider the problem of the nonlinear nudge.
                180   M O N K EY S O N T Y PE W R I TERS


Imagine a donkey equally hungry and thirsty placed at exactly
equal distance from sources of food and water. In such a frame­
work, he would die of both thirst and hunger as he would be un­
able to decide which one to get to first. Now inject some
randomness in the picture, by randomly nudging the donkey, caus­
ing him to get closer to one source, no matter which, and accord­
ingly away from the other.T he impasse would be instantly broken
and our happy donkey will be either in turn well fed then well hy­
drated, or well hydrated then well fed.
   T he reader no doubt has played a version of Buridan's donkey,
by "flipping a coin" to break some of the minor stalemates in life
where one lets randomness help with the decision process. Let
Lady Fortuna make the decision and gladly submit. I often use
Buridan's donkey (under its mathematical name) when my com­
puter goes into a freeze between two possibilities (to be technical,
these "randomizations" are frequently done during optimization
problems, when one needs to perturbate a function).
   Note that Buridan's donkey was named after the fourteenth­
century philosopher Jean Buridan. Buridan had an interesting
death (he was thrown in the Seine tied in a bag and died drown­
ing) .T his tale was considered an example of sophistry by his con­
temporaries who missed the import of randomization-Buridan
was clearly ahead of his time.


               W�EN IT RAINS, IT POURS

As I am writing these lines, I am suddenly realizing that th e
world's bipolarity is hitting me very hard. Either one succeeds
wildly, by attracting all the cash, or fails to draw a single penny.
Likewise with books. Either everyone wants to publish it, or no­
body is interested in returning telephone calls (in the latter case
my discipline is to delete the name from my address book).I am
also realizing the nonlinear effect behind success in anything: It is
                     LO S E R TA K E S A L L   181


better t o have a handful o f enthusiastic advocates than hordes of
people who appreciate your work-better to be loved by a dozen
than liked by the hundreds.This applies to the sales of books, the
spread of ideas, and success in general and runs counter to con­
ventional logic.The information age is worsening this effect.This
is making me, with my profound and antiquated Mediterranean
sense of metron (measure) , extremely uncomfortable, even queasy.
Too much success is the enemy (think of the punishment meted
out on the rich and famous); too much failure is demoralizing. I
would like the option of having neither.

that the two states are mutually exclusive (you can only be in one

you will be in one of them). They are equiprobable, with, in your
opinion, 50% probability assigned to each.

under uncertainty, is 50% in one of the vacation spots and 50% in

$ 1 , 000, which, in your opinion, is exactly fair. Tomorrow night
you will have zero or $2,000 in your pocket, each with a 50%
probability.In purely mathematical terms, the fair value of a bet is
the linear combination of the states, here called the mathematical
expectation, i.e., the probabilities of each payoff multiplied by the
dollar values at stake (50% multiplied by O and 50% multiplied by
$2,000 = $ 1 ,000) . Can you imagine (that is visualize, not compute
mathematically) the value being $ 1 ,000? We can conj ure up one
and only one state at a given time, i.e., either O or $2, 000. Left to
our own devices, we are likely to bet in an irrational way, as one of
the states would dominate the picture-the fear of ending with
nothing or the excitement of an extra $ 1 ,000.

Time to reveal Nero's secret. It was a black swan. He was then
thirty-five. Although prewar buildings in New York can have a
pleasant front, their architecture seen from the back offers a stark
                  184   M O N K EY S O N T Y PE W R I TER S


contrast by being completely bland. The doctor's examination
room had a window overlooking the backyard of one such Upper
East Side street, and Nero will always remember how bland that
backyard was in comparison with the front, even if he were to live
another half century. He will always remember the view of the
ugly pink backyard from the leaden window panes, and the med­
ical diploma on the wall that he read a dozen times as he was wait­
ing for the doctor to come into the room (half an eternity, for
Nero suspected that something was wrong) . The news was then
delivered (grave voice) , "I have some ... I got the pathology re­
port . . . It's . .. It is not as bad as it sounds . . .It's ...It's cancer."
The declaration caused his body to be hit by an electric discharge,
running through his back down to his knees. Nero tried to yell
"What?" but no sound came out of his mouth.What scared him
was not so much the news as the sight of the doctor. Somehow the
news reached his body before his mind.There was too much fear
in the doctor's eyes and Nero immediately suspected that the
news was even worse than what he was being told (it was) .
    The night of the diagnosis, at the medical library where he sat,
drenched wet from walking for hours in the rain without noticing
it and making a puddle of water around him (he was yelled at by
an attendant but could not concentrate on what she was saying so
she shrugged her shoulders and walked away); later he read the
sentence "72% 5-year actuarially adjusted survival rate." It meant
that 72 people out of 100 make it. It takes between three and five
years for the body without clinical manifestations of the disease
for the patient to be pronounced cured (closer to three at his age) .
He then felt in his guts quite certain that he was going to make it.
    Now the reader might wonder about the mathematical differ­
ence between a 28% chance of death and a 72% chance of survival
over the next five years. Clearly, there is none, but we are not
made for mathematics. In Nero's mind a 28% chance of death
meant the image of himself dead, and thoughts of the cumber-
               RANDOMNESS AND OUR MIND            185


some details of his funeral.A 7 2 % chance of survival put him in a
cheerful mood; his mind was planning the result of a cured Nero
skiing in the Alps.At no point during his ordeal did Nero think of
himself as 7 2 % alive and 28% dead.
  Just as Nero cannot "think " in complicated shades, consumers
consider a 7 5 % fat-free hamburger to be different from a 25% fat
one.Likewise with statistical significance. Even specialists tend to
infer too fast from data in accepting or rejecting things. Recall the
dentist whose emotional well-being depends on the recent per­
formance of his portfolio. Why? Because as we will see, rule­
determined behavior does not require nuances. Either you kill your
neighbor or you don't. Intermediate sentiments (leading, say, to
only half his killing) are either useless or downright dangerous when
you do things.The emotional apparatus that jolts us into action does
not understand such nuances-it is not efficient to understand
things.The rest of this chapter will rapidly illustrate some manifes­
tations of such blindness, with a cursory exposition of the research
in that area (only what connects to the topics in this book) .

For a long time we had the wrong product specifications when we
thought of ourselves.We humans have been under the belief that
we were endowed with a beautiful machine for thinking and un­
derstanding things. However, among the factory specifications for
us is the lack of awareness of the true factory specifications (why
complicate things?).The problem with thinking is that it causes
you to develop illusions.And thinking may be such a waste of en­
ergy! Who needs it!
   Consider that you are standing in front of a government clerk
in a heavily socialist country where being a bureaucrat is held to
be what respectable people do for a living. You are there to get
your papers stamped by him so you can export some of their
                186   M O N K EY S O N T Y PEW R I TERS


lovely chocolate candies to the New Jersey area, where you think
the local population would have a great taste for them. What do
you think his function is? Do you think for a minute that he cares
about the general economic theory behind the transaction? His
job is just to verify that you have the twelve or so signatures from
the right departments, true/false; then stamp your papers and let
you go. General considerations of economic growth or balance of
trade are none of his interests.In fact you are lucky that he doesn't
spend any time meditating about these things: Consider how long
the procedure would take if he had to solve balance of trade equa­
tions. He just has a rulebook and, over a career spanning forty to
forty-five years, he will just stamp documents, be mildly rude, and
go home to drink nonpasteurized beer and watch soccer games.If
you gave him Paul Krugman's book on international economics he
would either sell it in the black market or give it to his nephew.
   Accordingly, rules have their value.We just follow them not be­
cause they are the best but because they are useful and they save
time and effort. Consider that those who started theorizing upon
seeing a tiger on whether the tiger was of this or that taxonomic
variety, and the degree of danger it represented, ended up being
eaten by it. Others who just ran away at the smallest presumption
and were not slowed down by the smallest amount of thinking
ended up either outchasing the tiger or outchasing their cousin
who ended up being eaten by it.

                             Satisficing
It is a fact that our brains would not be able to operate without
such shortcuts. The first thinker who figured it out was Herbert
Simon, an interesting fellow in intellectual history. He started out
as a political scientist (but he was a formal thinker, not the literary
variety of political scientists who write about Afghanistan in For­
eign Affairs) ; he was an artificial-intelligence pioneer, taught com­
puter science and psychology, did research in cognitive science,
               RA N D O M IH: s s A N D O U R M I N D   1 87


philosophy, and applied mathematics, and received the Bank of
Sweden Prize for Economics in honor of Alfred Nobel. His idea is
that if we were to optimize at every step in life, then it would cost
us an infinite amount of time and energy.Accordingly, there has to
be in us an approximation process that stops somewhere. Clearly
he got his intuitions from computer science-he spent his entire
career at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, which has a
reputation as a computer science center. "Satisficing " was his idea
(the melding together of satisfy and suffice) : Yo��
get a near-satisfactory solution.Otherwise it may take you an eter­
nity to reach the smallest conclusion or perform the smallest act.
We are therefore rational, but in a limited way: "boundedly ra­
tional." He believed that our brains were a large optimizing ma­
chine that had built-in rules to stop somewhere.
   Not quite so, perhaps. It may not be just a rough approxima­
tion.For two (initially) Israeli researchers on human nature, how
we behave seemed to be a completely different process from the
optimizing machine presented by Simon.The two sat down intro­
specting in Jerusalem looking at aspects of their own thinking,
compared it to rational models, and noticed qualitative differ­
ences.Whenever they both seemed to make the same mistake of
reasoning they ran empirical tests on subjects, mostly students,
and discovered very surprising results on the relation between
thinking and rationality. It is to their discovery that we turn next.

                      Kahneman and Tversky
Who has exerted the most influence on economic thinking over
the past two centuries? No, it is not John Maynard Keynes, not Al­
fred Marshall, not Paul Samuelson, and certainly not Milton Fried­
man. The answer is two noneconomists: Daniel Kahneman and
Amos Tversky, the two Israeli introspectors, and their specialty
                188   M O N K EY S O N T Y PE W R I TERS


was to uncover areas where human beings are not endowed with
rational probabilistic thinking and optimal behavior under uncer­
tainty. Strangely, economists studied uncertainty for a long time
and did not figure out much-if anything, they thought they knew
something and were fooled by it. Aside from some penetrating
minds like Keynes, Knight, and Shackle, economists did not even
figure out that they had no clue about uncertainty-the discus­
sions on risk by their idols show that they did not know how much
they did not know. Psychologists, on the other hand, looked at the
problem and came out with solid results.Note that, unlike econo­
mists, they conducted experiments, true controlled experiments
of a repeatable nature, that can be done in Ulan Bator, Mongolia,
tomorrow if necessary. Conventional economists do not have this
luxury as they observe the past and make lengthy and mathemat­
ical comments, then bicker with each other about them.
    Kahneman and Tversky went in a completely different direc­
tion than Simon and started figuring out rules in humans that did
not make them rational-but things went beyond the shortcut.
For them, these rules, which are called heuristics, were not merely
a simplification of rational models, but were different in method­
ology and category.They called them "quick and dirty" heuristics.
There is a dirty part: These s �cuts �ith-side effects, these
effects being the biases, most�hich I discussed previously
throughout th�ch as the inability to accept anything ab­
stract as risk) . This started an empirical research tradition called
the "heuristics and biases " tradition that attempted to catalogue
them-it is impressive because of its empiricism and the experi­
mental aspect of the methods used.
    Since the Kahneman and Tversky results, an entire discipline
called behavioral finance and economics has flourished. It is in
open contradiction with the orthodox so-called neoclassical eco­
nomics taught in business schools and economics departments
under the normative names of efficient markets, rational expecta-
                  RA N D O M NES S A N D O U R M I N D    1 89


  tions, and other such concepts. It is worth stopping, at this junc­

                                                         -�-
ture, and discussing the distinction between normative and posi-
                                                        . .....___ _ ..-,

�.sciences. A normative science (clearly a self-contradictory
  concept) offers prescriptive teachings; it studies how things should
  be.Some economists, for example those of the efficient-market re­
  ligion, believe that our studies should be based on the hypothesis
  that humans are rational and act rationally because it is the best
  thing for them to do (it is mathematically "optimal ") . The oppo­
  site is a positive science, which is based on how people actually are
  observed to behave. In spite of economists' envy of physicists,
  physics is an inherently positive science while economics, particu­
  larly microeconomics and financial economics, is predominantly a
  normative one. Normative economics is like religion without the
  aesthetics.
     Note that the experimental aspect of the research implies that
  Daniel Kahneman and the experimental ponytailed economist
  Vernon Smith were the first true scientists ever to bow in front of
  the Swedish king for the economics prize, something that should
  give credibility to the Nobel academy, particularly if, like many,
  one takes Daniel Kahneman far more seriously than a collection of
  serious-looking (and very human, hence fallible) Swedes.There is
  another hint of the scientific firmness of this research: It is ex­
  tremely readable for someone outside of psychology, unlike papers
  in conventional economics and finance that even people in the
  field have difficulty reading (as the discussions are jargon-laden
  and heavily mathematical to give the illusion of science) .A moti­
  vated reader can get concentrated in four volumes the collection
  of the major heuristics and biases papers.
     Economists were not at the time very interested in hearing
  these stories of irrationality: Homo economicus as we said is a nor­
  mative concept.While they could easily buy the "Simon " argument
  that we are not perfectly rational and that life implies approxima­
  tions, particularly when the stakes are not large enough, they were
                1 90   M O N K EY S O N T Y PE W R I TER S


not willing to accept that people were flawed rather than imper­
fect.But they are.Kahneman and Tversky showed that these biases
do not disappear when there are incentives, which means that they
are not necessarily cost saving.They were a different form of rea­
soning, and one where the probabilistic reasoning was weak.


   W I-I E R E I S N A P O L E O N W I-I E N W E N E E D I-I I M ?

If your mind operates by series of different disconnected rules,
these may not be necessarily consistent with each other, and if
they may still do the job locally, they will not necessarily do so
globally. Consider them stored as a rulebook of sorts.Your reaction
will depend on which page of the book you open to at any point
in time. I will illustrate it with another socialist example.
    After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Western businesspeople
involved in what became Russia discovered an annoying (or en­
tertaining) fact about the legal system: It had conflicting and con­
tradictory laws.It just depended on which chapter you looked up.
I don't know whether the Russians wanted it as a prank (after all,
they lived long, humorless years of oppression) but the confusion
led to situations where someone had to violate a law to comply
with another. I have to say that lawyers are quite dull people to
talk to; talking to a dull lawyer who speaks broken English with a
strong accent and vodka breath can be quite straining-so you
give up. This spaghetti legal system came from the piecewise de­
velopment of the rules: You add a law here and there and the sit­
uation is too complicated as there is no central system that is
consulted every time to ensure compatibility of all the parts to­
gether. Napoleon faced a similar situation in France and remedied
it by setting up a top-down code of law that aimed to dictate a full
logical consistency. The problem with us humans is not so much
that no Napoleon has showed up so far to dynamite the old struc­
ture then reengineer our minds like a big central program; it is that
                RA N D O M N E S S A N D O U R M I N D   191


our minds are far more complicated than just a system of laws, and
the requirement for efficiency is far greater.
   Consider that your brain reacts differently to the same situa­
tion depending on which chapter you open to.The absence of a
central processing system makes us engage in decisions that can be
in conflict with each other.You may prefer apples to oranges, or­
anges to pears, but pears to apples-it depends on how the choices
are presented to you. The fact that your mind cannot retain and
use everything you know at once is the cause of such biases. One
central aspect of a heuristic is that it is blind to reasoning.

    "I'm As Good As My Last Trade" and Other Heuristics
There exist plenty of different catalogues of these heuristics in the
literature (many of them overlapping); the object of this discus­
sion is to provide the intuition behind their formation rather than
list them. For a long time we traders were totally ignorant of the
behavioral research and saw situations where there was with
strange regularity a wedge between the simple probabilistic rea­
soning and people's perception of things. We gave them names
such as the "I'm as good as my last trade " effect, the "sound-bite ef­
fect, " the "Monday morning quarterback " heuristic, and the "It was
obvious after the fact " effect. It was both vindicating for traders'
pride and disappointing to discover that they existed in the heuris­
tics literature as the "anchoring," the "affect heuristic, " and the
"hindsight bias " (it makes us feel that trading is true, experimental
scientific research) . The correspondence between the two worlds
is shown in Table 11. 1.
    I start with the "I'm as good as my last trade " heuristic (or the
"loss of perspective " bias)-the fact that the counter is reset at
zero and you start a new day or month from scratch, whether it is
your accountant who does it or your own mind. This is the most
significant distortion and the one that carries the most conse­
quences. In order to be able to put things in general context, you

do not have everything you know in your mind at all times, so you
retrieve the knowledge that you require at any given time in a
piecemeal fashion, which puts these retrieved knowledge chunks
in their local context. This means that you have an arbitrary refer­
ence point and react to differences from that point, forgetting that
you are only looking at the differences from that particular per­
spective of the local context, not the absolutes.
   There is the well-known trader maxim "life is incremental."
Consider that as an investor you examine your performance like
the dentist in Chapter 3, at some set interval. What do you look at:
your monthly, your daily, your life-to-date, or your hourly per-
               RA N D O M N ES S A N D O U R M I N D   193


formance? You can have a good month and a bad day. Which pe­
riod should dominate?
   When you take a gamble, do you say: "My net worth will end
up at $99,000 or $ 1 0 1 , 500 after the gamble " or do you say "I lose
$ 1 , 000 or make $ 1 , 500? " Your attitude toward the risks and re­
wards of the gamble will vary according to whether you look at
your net worth or changes in it.But in fact in real life you will be
put in situations where you will only look at your changes. The fact
that the losses hurt more than the gains, and differently, makes
your accumulated performance, that is, your total wealth, less rel­
evant than the last change in it.
   This dependence on the local rather than the global status
(coupled with the effect of the losses hitting harder than the
gains) has an impact on your perception of well-being.Say you get
a windfall profit of $ I million.The next month you lose $ 3 00,000.
You adjust to a given wealth (unless of course you are very poor)
so the following loss would hurt you emotionally, something that
would not have taken place if you received the net amount of
$ 700, 000 in one block, or, better, two sums of $3 50,000 each.In
addition, it is easier for your brain to detect differences rather than
absolutes, hence rich or poor will be ( above the minimum level)
in relation to something else (remember Marc and Janet) . Now,
when something is in relation to something else, that something
else can be manipulated.Psychologists call this effect of compar­
ing to a given reference anchoring. If we take it to its logical limit
we would realize that, because of this resetting, wealth itself does
not really make one happy (above, of course, some subsistence
level); but positive changes in wealth may, especially if they come
as "steady " increases. More on that later with my discussion of op­
tion blindness.
    Other aspects of anchoring. Given that you may use two dif­
ferent anchors in the same situation, the way you act depends on
so little. When people are asked to estimate a number, they will
                194     M O N K [ Y S O N T Y P£ WR I T £RS


position it with respect to a number they have in mind or one they
just heard, so "big" or "small" will be comparative. Kahneman and
Tversky asked subjects to estimate the proportion of African
countries in the United Nations after making them consciously
pull a random number between 0 and 100 (they knew it was a
random number) . People guessed in relation to that number,
which they used as anchor: Those who randomized a high number
guessed higher than those who randomized a low one.This morn­
ing I did my bit of anecdotal empiricism and asked the hotel
concierge how long it takes to go to the airport. "40 minutes?" I
asked. "About 3 5 ," he answered. Then I asked the lady at the re­
ception if the journey was 20 minutes. "No, about 2 5 ," she an­
swered. I timed the trip: 31 minutes.
   This anchorin�1,llllber: is the reason people do not react to
their total accumulated wealth, but to differences of wealth from
whatever number they are currently anchored to.This is the major
conflict with economic theory, as according to economists, some­
one with $ 1 million in the bank would be more satisfied than if he
had half a million. But we saw John reaching $1 million having
had a total of $10 million; he was happier when he only had half
a million (starting at nothing) than where we left him in Chapter
1.Also recall the dentist whose emotions depended on how fre­
quently he checked his portfolio.

                      Degree in a Fortune Cookie
I used to attend a health club in the middle of the day and chat
with an interesting Eastern European fellow with two Ph.D. de­
grees, one in physics (statistical no less) , the other in finance. He
worked for a trading house and was obsessed with the anecdotal
aspects of the markets.He once asked me doggedly what I thought
the stock market would do that day. Clearly I gave him a social an­
swer of the kind "I don't know, perhaps lower"-quite possibly the
opposite answer to what I would have given him had he asked me
                RA N D O M N E S S A N D O U R M I N D   195


an hour earlier. The next day he showed great alarm upon seeing
me. He went on and on discussing my credibility and wondering
how I could be so wrong in my "predictions, " since the market
went up subsequently. The man was able to derive conclusions
about my ability to predict and my "credibility " with a single ob­
servation. Now, if I went to the phone and called him and dis­
guised my voice and said, "Hello, this is Doktorr Talebski from
the Academy of Lodz and I have an interrresting prrroblem, " then
presented the issue as a statistical puzzle, he would laugh at me.
"Doktorr Talevski, did you get your degree in a fortune cookie? "
Why is it so?
   Clearly there are two problems.First, the quant did not use his
statistical brain when making the inference, but a different one.
Second, he made the mistake of overstating the importance of
small samples (in this case Just one single observation, the worst
possible inferential mistake a person can make) . Mathematicians
tend to make egregious mathematical mistakes outside of their
theoretical habitat.When Tversky and Kahneman sampled math­
ematical psychologists, some of whom were authors of statistical
textbooks, they were puzzled by their errors."Respondents put
too much confidence in the result of small samples and their sta­
tistical judgment showed little sensitivity to sample size." The puz­
zling aspect is that not only should they have known better, "they
did know better. " And yet ...
   I will next list a few more heuristics.( l ) The avail,ability heuris­
tic, which we saw in Chapter 3 with the earthquake in California
deemed more likely than catastrophe in the entire country, or
death from terrorism being more "likely " than death from all pos­
sible sources (including terrorism) . It corresponds to the practice
of estimating the frequency of an event according to the ease with
which instances of the event can be recalled. (2) The representa­
tiveness heuristic: gauging the probability that a person belongs to
a particular social group by assessing how similar the person's
                196    M O N K EY S O N T Y PE W R I TERS


characteristics are to the "typical" group member's. A feminist­
style philosophy student is deemed more likely to be a feminist
bank teller than to be just a bank teller.This problem is known as
the "Linda problem " (the feminist's name was Linda) and has
caused plenty of academic ink to flow (some of the people en­
gaged in the "rationality debate " believe that Kahneman and Tver­
sky are putting highly normative demands on us humans) . (3) The
simulation heuristic: the ease of mentally undoing an event-play­
ing the alternative scenario. It corresponds to counterfactual
thinking: Imagine what might have happened had you not missed
your train (or how rich you'd be today had you liquidated your
portfolio at the height of the NASDAQ bubble) . (4) We discussed
in Chapter 3 the affect heuristic: What emotions are elicited by
events determine their probability in your mind.

                      Two Systems of Reasoning
Later research refines the problem as follows: There are two pos­
sible ways for us to reason, the heuristics being part of one-ra­
tionality being part of the other.Recall the colleague who used a
different brain in the classroom than the one in real life in Chap­
ter 2. Didn't you wonder why the person you think knows physics
so well cannot apply the basic laws of physics by driving well? Re­
searchers divide the activities of our mind into the following two
polarized parts, called System 1 and System 2.
   System 1 is effortless, automatic, associative, rapid, parallel
process, opaque (i.e., we are not aware of using it), emotional, con­
crete, specific, social, and personalized.
   System 2 is effortful, controlled, deductive, slow, serial, self­
aware, neutral, abstract, sets, asocial, and depersonalized.
   I have always believed that professional option traders and mar­
ket makers by dint of practicing their probabilistic game build an
innate probabilistic machine that is far more developed than the
rest of the population-even that of probabilists. I found a confir-
                RA N D O M N !; S S A N D O U R M I N D   197


mation of that as researchers in the heuristics and biases tradition
believe that System 1 can be impacted by experience and inte­
grate elements from System 2. For instance, when you learn to
play chess, you use System 2. After a while things become intu­
itive and you are able to gauge the relative strength of an oppo­
nent by glancing at the board.
   Next I introduce the evolutionary psychology point of view.


     W M Y WE DON ' T M ARRY T M E l= IRS T DATE

Another branch of research, called evolutionary psychology, de­
veloped a completely different approach to the same problem. It
operates in parallel, creating some bitter but not too worrisome
academic debates. These evolutionary psychologists agree with
the Kahneman-Tversky school that people have difficulties with
standard probabilistic reasoning. However, they believe that the
reason lies in the way things are presented to us in the current en­
vironment. To them, we are optimized for a set of probabilistic
reasoning, but in a different environment than the one prevailing
today. The statement "Our brains are made for fitness not for
truth" by the scientific intellectual Steven Pinker, the public
spokesmen of that school, summarizes it all. They agree that our
brains are not made for understanding things but think that they
are not biased, or only biased because we do not use them in their
real habitat.
   Strangely, the Kahneman-Tversky school of researchers did not
incur any credible resistance from the opinions of the economists
of the time (the general credibility of conventional economists has
always been so low that almost nobody in science or in the real
world ever pays attention to them) . No, instead the challenge
came from the sociobiologists-and the center of the disagree­
ment lies in their belief in using evolutionary theory as a backbone
for our understanding of human nature.While this caused a fierce
                    198   M O N K E Y S O N T Y PE W R I TER S


   scientific dispute, I will have to say that they agree on the signifi­
   cant part as far as this book is concerned: (1) We do not think
_)
   when making choices but use heuristics; (2) We make serious
   probabilistic mistakes in today's world-whatever the trne reas on.
   Note that the split even covers the new economics: Just as we
   have a scientific branch of economics coming out of the Kahne­
   man and Tversky tradition (behavioral economics) , there is an­
   other scientific branch of economics coming out of evolutionary
   psychology, with the caveman economics approach followed by
   such researchers as the economist-biologist Terry Burnham, coau­
   thor of the very readable Mean Genes.

                           Ou r Natural Hab itat
    I will not delve too deeply into amateur evolutionary theory to
    probe at the reasons (besides, in spite of having spent some time in
    libraries I feel that I am truly an amateur in the subject matter) .
    Clearly, the environment for which we have built our endowment
    is not the one that prevails today. I have not told too many of my
    colleagues that their decision making contains some lingering
    habits of cavemen-but when markets experience an abrupt
    move, I experience the same rush of adrenaline as if a leopard
    were seen prowling near my trading desk. Some of my colleagues
    who break telephone handles upon losing money might be even
    closer in their psychological makeup to our common origin.
        This might be a platitude to those who frequent the Greek and
    Latin classics, but we never fail to be surprised when noticing that
    people a couple of dozen centuries removed from us can exhibit
    similar sensibility and feelings.What used to strike me as a child
    upon visiting museums is that ancient Greek statues exhibit men
    with traits indistinguishable from ours (only more harmonious
    and aristocratic) . I was so wrong to believe that 2 , 200 years was a
    long time. Proust wrote frequently about the surprise people have
    when coming across emotions in Homeric heroes that are similar
               RA N D O M N E S S A N D O U R M I N D   199


to those we experience today. By genetic standards, these Home­
ric heroes of thirty centuries ago in all likelihood have the exact
identical makeup as the pud gy middle-aged man you see schlep­
ping groceries in the parking lot. More than that. In fact, we are
truly identical to the man who perhaps eighty centuries ago
started being called "civilized," in that strip of land stretching from
southeastern Syria to southwestern Mesopotamia.
   What is our natural habitat? By natural habitat, I mean the en­
vironment in which we reproduced the most, the one in which we
spent the highest number of generations. The consensus among
anthropologists is that we have been around as a separate species
for 13 0, 000 years, most of which were spent in the African savan­
nah.But we do not have to go back that far in history to get the
point.Imagine life in an early urban settlement, in Middle-Town,
Fertile Crescent, only about 3 , 000 years ago-surely modern
times from a genetic standpoint. Information is limited by the
physical means of its transmission; one cannot travel fast, hence in­
formation will come from faraway places in concise batches.Trav­
eling is a nuisance fraught with all manner of physical danger; you
will settle within a narrow radius of where you were born unless
famine or some invading uncivilized tribe dislodges you and your
relatives from your happy settlement.The number of people you
would get to know in a lifetime will be small. Should a crime be
committed, it will be easy to gauge the evidence of guilt within
the small number of possible suspects. If you are unjustly con­
victed of a crime, you will argue in simple terms, propounding
simple evidence like "I was not there as I was praying in the tem­
ple of Baal and was seen at dusk by the high priest" and add that
Obedshemesh, son of Sahar, was more likely to be guilty because
he had more to gain from the crime. Your life would be simple,
hence your space of probabilities would be narrow.
  The real problem is, as I have mentioned, that such a natural
habitat does not include much information.An efficient computa-
                   200    M O N K EY S O N T Y P l: W R I T l: R S


   tion of the odds was never necessary until very recently.This also
   explains why we had to wait until the emergence of the gambling
   literature to see the growth of the mathematics of probability.
   Popular belief holds that the religious backdrop of the first and
   second millennia blocked the growth of tools that hint at absence
   of determinism, and caused the delays in probability research.The
      idea is extremely dubious; we simply did not compute probabili­
      ties because we did not dare to? Surely the reason is rather be­
      cause we did not need to. Much of our problem comes from the
      fact that we have evolved out of such a habitat faster, much faster,
_.,., than our genes.Even worse, our genes have not changed at all.

                              Fast and Fru gal
   Evolutionary theorists agree that brainwork depends on how the
   subject is presented and the frame offered-and they can be con­
   tradictory in their results.We detect cheaters with a different part
   of our brain than the one we draw on to solve logical problems.
   People can make incoherent choices because the brain works in
   the form of small partial jobs.Those heuristics that we said were
   "quick and dirty" to the psychologists are "fast and frugal " to the
   evolutionary psychologists. Not only that, but some thinkers, like
   the cognitive scientist Gerd Gigerenzer, seem to have obsessively
   taken the other side of the trade from Kahneman and Tversky; his
   work and that of his associates at the ABC Group (Adaptive Be­
   havior and Cognition) intend to show that we are rational and that
   evolution produces a form of rationality he calls "ecological ra­
   tionality. " They believe that not only are we hard-wired for opti­
   mizing probabilistic behavior in situations like mate selection (how
   many people of the opposite sex do you need to meet before
   pulling the trigger?), or choosing a meal, but we are also so wired
   for stock selection and that we do it appropriately if the stocks are
   presented to us in the correct manner.
      ln fact, Gigerenzer agrees that we do not understand probabil-
               RA N D O M N ES S A N D O U R M I N D   201


ity (too abstract), but we react rather well to frequencies (less ab­
stract) : According to him, some problems that normally would
cause us to make a mistake disappear when phrased in terms of
percentages.
    According to these researchers, while we may like to think of
our brain as a central processing system, with top-down features,
an analogy to the Swiss Army knife (with its small :;pecific tools)
seems to be in order. How? The psychologists' framework is built
around the distinction between the domain-specific and domain­
general adaptations. A domain-specific adaptation is something
that is meant to solve a very precise task (as opposed to domain­
general ones that are meant to solve global ones) . While these are
easy to understand and accept for physiological adaptations (i.e., a
giraffe's neck helps in reaching food or an animal's colors in pro­
viding camouflage), people have had difficulties accepting why
these apply to our mind in the same manner.
    Our brain functions by "modules." An interesting aspect of
modularity is that we may use different modules for different in­
stances of the same problem, depending on the framework in
which it is presented-as discussed in the notes to this section.
One of the attributes of a module is its "encapsulation," i.e., we
cannot interfere with its functioning, as we are not aware of using
it. The most striking module is used when we try to find a cheater.
Expressed in purely logical form (though with extreme clarity) , a
given quiz is only solved by 1 5% of the people to whom it is given.
Now, the same quiz expressed in a manner that aims at uncover­
ing a cheater, almost everyone gets it.

                        Neurobiologists Too
Neurobiologists also have their side of the story. They believe
(roughly) that we have three brains: The very old one, the reptilian
brain that dictates heartbeat and that we share with all animals; the
limbic brain center of emotions that we share with mammals; and
                202   M O N K EY S O N T Y PE W R I TERS


the neocortex, or cognitive brain, that distinguishes primates and
humans (note that even institutional investors seem to have a neo­
cortex) . While that theory of the Triune brain shows some over­
simplification (particularly when handled by journalists), it seems
to provide a framework for the analysis of brain functions.
    Although it is very difficult to figure out which part of the brain
does what exactly, neuroscientists have been doing some environ­
ment mapping in the brain by, say, taking a patient whose brain is
damaged in one single spot (say, by a tumor or an inj ury deemed
to be local) and deducing by elimination the function performed
by such part of the anatomy. Other methods include brain imag­
ing and electric simulations to specific areas. Many researchers
outside of neurobiology, like the philosopher and cognitive scien­
tist Jerry Fodor (who pioneered the notion of modularity) remain
skeptical about the quality of the knowledge that we can uncover
by examining the physical properties of the brain, be it only on ac­
count of the complicated interactions of the single parts (with
corresponding nonlinearities) . The mathematician and cognitive
scientist David Marr, who pioneered the field of object recogni­
tion, made the apt remark that one does not learn how birds fly
by studying feathers but rather by studying aerodynamics. I will
present the theses of two watershed works presented in readable
books, Damasio's Descartes ' Error and LeDoux's Emotional Brain.
    Descartes' Error presents a very simple thesis: You perform a
surgical ablation on a piece of someone's brain (say, to remove a
tumor and tissue around it) with the sole resulting effect of an in­
ability to register emotions, nothing else (the IQ and every other
faculty remain the same) .What you have done is a controlled ex­
periment to separate someone's intelligence from his emotions.
Now you have a purely rational human being unencumbered with
feelings and emotions. Let's watch: Damasio reported that the
purely unemotional man was incapable of making the simplest de­
cision. He could not get out of bed in the morning, and frittered
               RA N D O M N ES S A N D O U R M I N D   2 03


away his days fruitlessly weighing decisions. Shock] This flies in
the face of everything one would have expected: One cannot
make a decision without emotion. Now, mathematics gives the
same answer: If one were to perform an optimizing operation
across a large collection of variables, even with a --brain as large as
ours, it would take a very long time to decide on the simplest of
tasks. So we need a shortcut; emotions are there to prevent us
from temporizing. Does it remind you of Herbert Simon's idea? It
seems that the emotions are the ones doing the job.Psychologists
call them "lubricants of reason. "
   Joseph LeDoux's theory about the role of emotions in behavior
is even more potent: Emotions affect one's thinking. He figured
out that much of the connections from the emotional systems to
the cognitive systems are stronger than connections from the cog­
nitive systems to the emotional systems. The implication is that
we feel emotions (limbic brain) then find an explanation (neocor­
tex) .As we saw with Claparede's discovery, much of the opinions
and assessments that we have concerning risks may be the simple
result of emotions.

                       Kafka in a Courtroom
The 0.J. Simpson trial provides an example of how our modern
society is ruled by probability (because of the explosion in infor­
mation) , while important decisions are made without the smallest
regard for its basic laws.We are capable of sending a spacecraft to
Mars, but we are incapable of having criminal trials managed by
the basic laws of probability-yet evidence is clearly a probabilis­
tic notion. I remember buying a book on probability at a Borders
Books chain bookstore only a short distance from the Los Angeles
courthouse where the "trial of the century " was taking place-an­
other book that crystallized the highly sophisticated quantitative
knowledge in the field.How could such a leap in knowledge elude
lawyers and jurors only a few miles away?
                204    MONKEYS ON TYPEWRITERS


    People who are as close to being criminal as probability laws
can allow us to infer (that is, with a confidence that exceeds the
shadow of a doubt) are walking free because of our misunder­
standing of basic concepts of the odds. Equally, you could be con­
victed for a crime you never committed, again owing to a poor
reading of probability-for we still cannot have a court of law
properly compute the joint probability of events (the probability
of two events taking place at the same time) . I was in a dealing
room with a TV set turned on when I saw one of the lawyers ar­
guing that there were at least four people in Los Angeles capable
of carrying 0. J. Simpson's DNA characteristics (thus ignoring the
joint set of events-we will see how in the next paragraph) . I then
switched off the television set in disgust, causing an uproar among
the traders. I was under the impression until then that sophistry
had been eliminated from legal cases thanks to the high standards
of republican Rome. Worse, one Harvard lawyer used the specious
argument that only I 0% of men who brutalize their wives go on
to murder them, which is a probability unconditional on the mur­
der (whether the statement was made out of a warped notion of
advocacy, pure malice, or ignorance is immaterial) . Isn't the law
devoted to the truth? The correct way to look at it is to determine
the percentage of murder cases where women were killed by their
husbands and had previously been battered by them (that is,
50%)-for we are dealing with what is called conditional probabil­
ities; the probability that O.J. killed his wife conditional on the in­
formation of her having been killed, rather than the unconditional
probability of O.J. killing his wife. How can we expect the un­
trained person to understand randomness when a Harvard profes­
sor who deals and teaches the concept of probabilistic evidence
can make such an incorrect statement?
    More particularly, where jurors (and lawyers) tend to make
mistakes, along with the rest of us, is in the notion of joint proba­
bility. They do not realize that evidence compounds. The proba-
               RANDOMNESS AND OUR MIND             205


bility of my being diagnosed with respiratory tract cancer and
being run over by a pink Cadillac in the same year, assuming each
one of them is 1 / 1 00, 000, becomes l / 1 0,000, 000,000-by multi­
plying the two ( obviously independent) events. Arguing that 0. J.
Simpson had 1 /500,000 chance of not being the killer from the
blood standpoint (remember the lawyers used the sophistry that
there were four people with such blood types walking around Los
Angeles) and adding to it the fact that he was the husband of the
person and that there was additional evidence, then ( owing to the
compounding effect) the odds against him rise to several trillion
trillion.
   "Sophisticated " people make worse mistakes. I can surprise
people by saying that the probability of the joint event is lower
than either. Recall the availability heuristic: with the Linda prob­
lem rational and educated people finding the likelihood of an
event greater than that of a larger one that encompasses it. I am
glad to be a trader taking advantage of people 's biases but I am
scared of living in such a society.

                         An Absurd World
Kafka's prophetic book, The Trial, about the plight of a man, Joseph
K., who is arrested for a mysterious and unexplained reason, hit a
spot as it was written before we heard of the methods of the "scien­
tific" totalitarian regimes. It projected a scary future of mankind
wrapped in absurd self-feeding bureaucracies, with spontaneously
emerging rules subjected to the internal logic of the bureaucracy. It
spawned an entire "literature of the absurd " ; the world may be too
incongruous for us. I am terrified of certain lawyers.After listening
to statements during the O.J. trial (and their effect) I was scared,
truly scared, of the possible outcome-my being arrested for some
reason that made no sense probabilistically, and having to fight some
glib lawyer in front of a randomness illiterate jury.
   We said that mere judgment would probably suffice in a prim-
                206   M O N K EY S O N T Y PE W R I TERS


itive society.It is easy for a society to live without mathematics­
or traders to trade without quantitative methods-when the
space of possible outcomes is one-dimensional. One-dimensional
means that we are looking at one sole variable, not a collection of
separate events.The price of one security is one-dimensional,
whereas the collection of the prices of several securities is multi­
dimensional and requires mathematical modeling-we cannot
easily see the collection of possible outcomes of the portfolio
with a naked eye, and cannot even represent it on a graph as our
physical world has been limited to visual representation in three
dimensions only. We will argue later why we run the risk of hav­
ing bad models (admittedly, we have) or making the error of con­
doning ignorance-swinging between the Carybde of the lawyer
who knows no math to the Scylla of the mathematician who mis­
uses his math because he does not have the judgment to select
the right model.In other words, we will have to swing between
the mistake of listening to the glib nonsense of a lawyer who re­
fuses science and that of applying the flawed theories of some
economist who takes his science too seriously.The beauty of sci­
ence is that it makes an allowance for both error types.Luckily,
there is a middle road-but sadly, it is rarely traveled.

       Examples of Biases in Understanding Probability
I found in the behavioral literature at least forty damning exam­
ples of such acute biases, systematic departures from rational be­
havior widespread across professions and fields. Below is the
account of a well-known test, and an embarrassing one for the
medical profession.The following famous quiz was given to med­
ical doctors (which I borrowed from the excellent Deborah Ben­
nett's Randomness) .

  A test of a disease presents a rate of 5% false positives.Th e dis­
  ease strikes 1 / 1 ,000 of the population.People are tested at ran-
               RA N D O M N ES S A N D O U R M I N D   207


   dom, regardless of whether they are suspected of having the dis­
   ease. A patient's test is positive. What is the probability of the
   patient being stricken with the disease?


Most doctors answered 95%, simply taking into account the fact
that the test has a 95% accuracy rate. The answer is the conditional
probability that the patient is sick and the test shows it-close to
2%. Less than one in five professionals got it right.
  I will simplify the answer (using the frequency approach). As­
sume no false negatives. Consider that out of 1 , 000 patients who
are administered the test, one will be expected to be afflicted with
the disease. Out of a population of the remaining 999 healthy pa­
tients, the test will identify about 50 with the disease (it is 95% ac­
curate). The correct answer should be that the probability of being
afflicted with the disease for someone selected at random who
presented a positive test is the following ratio:

                    Number of afflicted persons
                Number of true and false positives

here 1 in 5 1 .
  Think of the number of times you will be given a medication
that carries damaging side effects for a given disease you were told
you had, when you may only have a 2% probability of being af­
flicted with it)

                        We Are Option B lind
As an option trader, I have noticed that people tend to undervalue
options as they are usually unable to correctly mentally evaluate
instruments that deliver an uncertain payoff, even when they are
fully conscious of the mathematics. Even regulators reinforce such
ignorance by explaining to people that options are a decaying or
wasting asset. Options that are out of the money are deemed to
decay, by losing their premium between two dates.
                208   M O N K E Y S O N T Y PE W R I TERS


   I will clarify next with a simplified (but sufficient) explanation
of what an option means. Say a stock trades at $ 100 and that
someone gives me the right (but not the obligation) to buy it at
$ 110 one month ahead of today. This is dubbed a call option. It
makes sense for me to exercise it, by asking the seller of the option
to deliver me the stock at $ 110, only if it trades at a higher price
than $ 110 in one month's time.If the stock goes to $ 120, my op­
tion will be worth $ 10, for I will be able to buy the stock at $ 110
from the option writer and sell it to the market at $ 120, pocketing
the difference. But this does not have a very high probability. It is
called out-of-the-money, for I have no gain from exercising it right
away.
   Consider that I buy the option for $ 1. What do I expect the
value of the option to be one month from now? Most people think
0. That is not true. The option has a high probability, say 90%, of
being worth O at expiration, but perhaps 10% probability to be
worth an average of $ 10.Thus, selling the option to me for $ 1 does
not provide the seller with free money. If the seller had instead
bought the stock himself at $ 100 and waited the month, he could
have sold it for $ 120. Making $ 1 now was hardly, therefore, free
money. Likewise, buying it is not a wasting asset. Even profession­
als can be fooled. How? They confuse the expected value and the
most likely scenario (here the expected value is $ 1 and the most
likely scenario is for the option to be worth 0) . They mentally
overweigh the state that is the most likely, namely, that the mar­
ket does not move at all.The option is simply the weighted aver­
age of the possible states the asset can take.
    There is another type of satisfaction provided by the option
seller. It is the steady return and the steady feeling of reward­
what psychologists call flow. It is very pleasant to go to work in the
morning with the expectation of being up some small money. It
requires some strength of character to accept the expectation of
bleeding a little, losing pennies on a steady basis even if the strat-
               RA N D O M N E S S A N D O U R M I N D   2 09


egy is bound to be profitable over longer periods. I noticed that
very few option traders can maintain what I call a "long volatility "
position, namely a position that will most likely lose a small quan­
tity of money at expiration, but is expected to make money in the
long run because of occasional spurts.I discovered very few peo­
ple who accepted losing $ 1 for most expirations and making $ 1 0
once in a while, even if the game were fair (i.e., they made the $ 1 0
more than 9 .1 % of the time) .
   I divide the community of option traders into two categories:
premium sellers and premium buyers. Premium sellers (also called "'�-"
option sellers) sell options, and generally make steady money, like
John in Chapters 1 and 5. Premium buyers do the reverse. Option
sellers, it is said, eat like chickens and go to the bathroom like ele­
phants.Alas, most option traders I encountered in my career are
premium sellers-when they blow up it is generally other people's
money.
   How could professionals seemingly aware of the (simple)
mathematics be put in such a position? As previously discussed,
our actions are not quite guided by the parts of our brain that dic­
tate rationality.We think with our emotions and there is no way
around it.For the same reason, people who are otherwise rational
engage in smoking or in fights that get them no immediate bene­
fits; likewise people sell options even when they know that it is
not a good thing to do. But things can get worse.There is a cate­
gory of people, generally finance academics, who, instead of fitting
their actions to their brains, fit their brains to their actions.These
people go back and unwittingly cheat with the statistics to justify -k
their actions.In my business, they fool themselves with statistical
arguments to justify their option selling.
   What is less unpleasant: to lose 1 00 times $ 1 or lose once $ 1 00?
Clearly the second: Our sensitivity to losses decreases. So a trading
policy that makes $ 1 a day for a long time then loses them all is ac­
tually pleasant from a hedonic standpoint, although it does not
                210   M O N K EY S O N T Y PE W R I TER S


make sense economically.So there is an incentive to invent a story
about the likelihood of the events and carry on such strategy.
   In addition, there is the risk ignorance factor. Scientists have
subjected people to tests-what I mentioned in the prologue as
risk taking out of underestimating the risks rather than courage.
The subjects were asked to predict a range for security prices in
the future, an upper bound and a lower bound, in such a way that
they would be comfortable with 98% of the security ending inside
such range.Of course violations to such bound were very large, up
to 30%.
   Such violations arise from a far more severe problem: People
overvalue their knowledge and underestimate the probability of
their being wrong.
    One example to illustrate further option blindness.What has
more value? (a) a contract that pays you $ 1 million if the stock
market goes down l 0% on any given day in the next year; (b) a
contract that pays you $ 1 million if the stock market goes down
10% on any given day in the next year due to a terrorist act. I ex­
pect most people to select (b) .

                  (MORE JOURNALISTS)

A journalist is trained in methods to express himself rather than to
plumb the depth of things-the selection process favors the most
communicative, not necessarily the most knowledgeable. My
medical doctor friends claim that many medical journalists do not
understand anything about medicine and biology, often making
mistakes of a very basic nature. I cannot confirm such statements,
being myself a mere amateur (though at times a voracious reader)
in medical research, but I have noticed that they almost always
misunderstand the probabilities used in medical research an­
nouncements. The most common one concerns the interpretation
               RA N D O M N ES S A N D O U R M I N D   211


of evidence.They most commonly get mixed up between absence
of evidence and evidence of absence, a similar problem to the one we
saw in Chapter 9. How? Say I test some chemotherapy, for in­
stance Fluorouracil, for upper respiratory tract cancer, and find
that it is better than a placebo, but only marginally so; that (in ad­
dition to other modalities) it improves survival from 2 1 per 100 to
2 4 per 100. Given my sample size, I may not be confident that the
additional 3 % survival points come from the medicine; it could be
merely attributable to randomness. I would write a paper outlin­
ing my results and saying that there is no evidence of improved
survival (as yet) from such medicine, and that further research
would be needed. A medical journalist would pick it up and claim
that one Professor N. N. Taleb found evidence that Fluorouracil
does not help, which is entirely opposite to my intentions. Some
naive doctor in Smalltown, even more uncomfortable with proba­
bilities than the most untrained journalist, would pick it up and
build a mental block against the medication, even when some re­
searcher finally finds fresh evidence that such medicine confers a
clear survival advantage.

                       CNB C at Lunchtime
The advent of the financial television channel CNBC presented
plenty of benefits to the financial community but it also allowed a
collection of extrovert practitioners long on theories to voice them
in a few minutes of television time. One often sees respectable
people making ludicrous (but smart-sounding) statements about
properties of the stock market.Among these are statements that
blatantly violate the laws of probability. One summer during
which I was assiduous at the health club, I often heard statements
such as "the real market is only 10% off the highs while the aver­
age stock is close to 40% off its highs, " which is intended to be in­
dicative of deep troubles or anomalies-some harbinger of bear
markets.
                212   M O N KEY S O N T Y PE W R I TERS


   There is no incompatibility between the fact that the average
stock is down 40% from the highs while the average of all stocks
(that is, the market) is down 10% from its own highs. One must
consider that the stocks did not all reach their highs at the same
time. Given that stocks are not I 00% correlated, stock A might
reach its maximum in January, stock B might reach its maximum
in April, but the average of the two stocks A and B might reach its
maximum at some time in February. Furthermore, in the event of
negatively correlated stocks, if stock A is at its maximum when
stock B is at its minimum, then they could both be down 40%
from their maximum when the stock market is at its highs! By a
law of probability called distribution of the maximum of random
variables, the maximum of an average is necessarily less volatile
than the average maximum.

This brings to mind another common violation of probability by
prime-time TV financial experts, who may be selected for their
looks, their charisma, and their presentation skills, but certainly
not for their incisive minds. For instance, a fallacy that I saw com­
monly made by a prominent TV financial guru goes as follows:
"The average American is expected to live seventy-three years.
Therefore if you are sixty-eight you can expect to live five more
years, and should plan accordingly." She went into precise pre­
scriptions of how the person should invest for a five-more-years
horizon. Now what if you are eighty? Is your life expectancy
minus seven years? What these journalists confuse is the uncondi­
tional and conditional life expectancy. At birth, your uncondi­
tional life expectancy may be seventy-three years. But as you
advance in age and do not die, your life expectancy increases along
with your life. Why? Because other people, by dying, have taken
your spot in the statistics, for expectation means average.So if you
are seventy-three and are in good health, you may still have, say,
               RA N D O M N !; S S A N D O U R M I N D   213


nine years in expectation. But the expectation would change, and
at eighty-two, you will have another five years, provided of course
you are still alive. Even someone one hundred years old still has a
positive conditional life expectation.Such a statement, when one
thinks about it, is not too different from the one that says: Our
operation has a mortality rate of l % .So far we have operated on
ninety-nine patients with great success; you are our one hundreth,
hence you have a l 00% probability of dying on the table.
   TV financial planners may confuse a few people. This is quite
harmless.What is far more worrying is the supply of information
by nonprofessionals to professionals; it is to the journalists that we
turn next.

                   The Bloomberg Explanations
I have, on my desk, a machine eponymously called a Bloomberg
(after the legendary founder Michael Bloomberg).It acts as a safe
e-mail service, a news service, a historical-data retrieving tool, a
charting system, an invaluable analytical aid, and, not least, a
screen where I can see the price of securities and currencies. I have
gotten so addicted to it that I cannot operate without it, as I would
otherwise feel cut off from the rest of the world. I use it to get in
contact with my friends, confirm appointments, and solve some of
those entertaining quarrels that put some sharpness into life.
Somehow, traders who do not have a Bloomberg address do not
exist for us (they have to have recourse to the more plebeian In­
ternet). But there is one aspect of Bloomberg I would dispense
with: the journalist's commentary.Why? Because they engage in
explaining things and perpetuate the right-column, left-column
confusion in a serious manner. Bloomberg is not the sole perpetra­
tor; it is just that I have not been exposed to newspapers' business
sections over the past decade, preferring to read real prose instead.
   As I am writing these lines I see the following headlines on my
Bloomberg:
                      214   M O N K EY S O N T Y PE W R I TERS


        ➔ Dow is up 1 .03 on lower interest rates.
        ➔ Dollar down 0.1 2 yen on higher Japanese surplus.

     and so on for an entire page. If I translate it well, the journalist
     claims to provide an explanation for something that amounts to
.f   peefect noise. A move of 1.03 with the Dow at 11, 000 constitutes
     less than a 0.01% move. Such a move does not warrant an expla­
     nation. There is nothing there that an honest person can try to
     explain; there are no reasons to adduce. But like apprentice pro­
     fessors of comparative literature, journalists being paid to provide
     explanations will gladly and readily provide them.The only solu­
     tion is for Michael Bloomberg to stop paying his journalists for
     providing commentary.
         Significance: How did I decide that it was perfect noise? Take a
     simple analogy. If you engage in a mountain bicycle race with a
     friend across Siberia and, a month later, beat him by one single
     second, you clearly cannot quite boast that you are faster than
     him.You might have been helped by something, or it can be just
     plain randomness, nothing else. That second is not in itself signifi­
     cant enough for someone to draw conclusions. I would not write
     in my pre-bedtime diary: Cyclist A is better than cyclist B because he
     is Jed with spinach whereas cyclist B has a diet rich in tofu. The rea­
     son I am making this inference is because he beat him by 1 .3 seconds
     in a 3, 000 mile race. Should the difference be one week, then I
     could start analyzing whether tofu is the reason, or if there are
     other factors.
         Causality: There is another problem; even assuming statistical
     significance, one has to accept a cause and effect, meaning that the
     event in the market can be linked to the cause proffered. Post hoc
     ergo propter hoc (it is the consequence because it came after).Say
     hospital A delivered 52% boys and hospital B delivered the same
     year only 48%; would you try to give the explanation that you had
     a boy because it was delivered in hospital A?
                RA N D O M N E S S A N D O U R M I N D   21 5


   Causality can be very complex. It is very difficult to isolate a
single cause when there are plenty around. This is called multi­
variate analysis. For instance, if the stock market can react to U.S.
domestic interest rates, the dollar against the yen, the dollar
against the European currencies, the European stock markets, the
United States balance of payments, United States inflation, and
another dozen prime factors, then the j ournalists need to look at
all of these factors, look at their historical effect both in isolation
and jointly, look at the stability of such influence, then, after con­
sulting the test statistic, isolate the factor if it is possible to do so.
Finally, a proper confidence level needs to be given to the factor it­
self; if it is less than 90% the story would be dead.I can understand
why Hume was extremely obsessed with causality and could not
accept such inference anywhere.
   I have a trick to know if something real in the world is taking
place. I have set up my Bloomberg monitor to display the price
and percentage change of all relevant prices in the world: curren­
cies, stocks, interest rates, and commodities.By dint of looking at
the same setup for years, as I keep the currencies in the upper left
corner and the various stock markets on the right, I managed to
build an instinctive way of knowing if something serious is going
on.The trick is to look only at the large percentage changes.Un�
less something moves by more than its usual daily percentage
change, the event is deemed to be noise.Percentage moves are the
size of the headlines.In addition, the interpretation is not linear; a
2% move is not twice as significant an event as 1 %, it is rather like ,.s{t
four to ten times.A 7% move can be several billion times more rel­
evant than a l % move] The headline of the Dow moving by 1.3
points on my screen today has less than one billionth of the signif­
icance of the serious 7 % drop of October 199 7 . People might ask
me: Why do I want everybody to learn some statistics? The answer
is that too many people read explanations.We cannot instinctively
understand the nonlinear aspect of probability.

                              Filtering Methods
Engineers use methods to clean up the noise from the signal in the
data. Did it ever occur to you while talking to your cousin in Aus­
tralia or the South Pole that the static on the telephone line could
be distinguished from the voice of your correspondent? The
method is to consider that when a change in amplitude is small, it
is more likely to result from noise-with its likelihood of being a
signal increasing exponentially as its magnitude increases. The
method is called a smoothing kernel, which has been applied in
Figures 11.1 and 11.2 .But our auditory system is incapable of per­
forming such a function by itself Likewise our brain cannot see the
difference between a significant price change and mere noise, par­
ticularly when it is pounded with unsmoothed journalistic noise.

              We Do Not Understand Confidence Levels

the opinion. Consider that you are going on a trip one fall morn­
ing and need to formulate an idea about the weather conditions
prior to packing your luggage.If you expect the temperature to be
60 degrees, plus or minus 10 degrees (say in Arizona) , then you
would take no snow clothes and no portable electric fan. Now,
what if you were going to Chicago, where you are told that the
weather, while being 60 degrees, will nevertheless vary by about
30 degrees? You would have to pack winter and summer clothes.
Here the expectation of the temperature carries little importance
concerning the choice of clothing; it is the variance that matters.
Your decision to pack is markedly different now that you are told
that the variability would be around 30 degrees. Now let us push
the point further; what if you were going to a planet where the ex­
pectation is also going to be around 60 degrees, but plus or minus
500 degrees? What would you pack?
   We can see that my activity in the market (and other random
variables) depends far less on where I think the market or the ran­
dom variable is going so much as it does on the degree of error I
allow around such a confidence level.

We close this chapter with the following information: I consider
myself as prone to foolishness as anyone I know, in spite of my
profession and the time spent building my expertise on the sub­
ject.But here is the exception; I know that I am very, very weak on
that score.My humanity will try to foil me; I have to stay on my - J
guard. I was born to be fooled by randomness. That will be ex­
plored in Part III.

         dysseus, the Homerian hero, had the reputation of using
         guile to overcome stronger opponents. I find the most
         spectacular use of such guile was against no other oppo-
nent than himself
   In Book 12 of the Odyssey, the hero encounters the sirens, on an
island not far from the rocks of Charybdis and Scylla.Their songs
are known to charm the sailors into madness, causing them irre­
sistibly to cast themselves into the sea off the sirens' coast, and per­
ish.The indescribable beauty of the sirens' songs is contrasted with
the moldering corpses of sailors who strayed into the area around
them.Odysseus, forewarned by Circe, contrives the following ruse.
He fills the ears of all his men with wax, to the point of total deaf­
ness, and has himself tied to the mast. The sailors are under strict
instructions not to release him.As they approach the sirens' island,
the sea is calm and over the water comes the sound of a music so
ravishing that Odysseus struggles to get loose, expending an inordi­
nate amount of energy to unrestrain himself His men tie him even
further, until they are safely past the poisoned sounds.
   The first lesson I took from the story is not to even attempt to
be Odysseus. He is a mythological character and I am not. He can
be tied to the mast; I can merely reach the rank of a sailor who
needs to have his ears filled with wax.

   The epiphany I had in my career in randomness came when I un­
 i derstood that I was not intelligent enough, nor strong enough, to
   even try to fight my emotions. Besides, I believe that I need my
,�
   emotions to formulate my ideas and get the energy to execute
   them.
        I am just intelligent enough to understand that I have a predis­
   position to be fooled by randomness-and to accept the fact that
   I am rather emotional. I am dominated by my emotions-but as
   an aesthete, I am happy about that fact. I am just like every single
   character whom I ridiculed in this book.Not only that, but I may
   be even worse than them because there may be a negative corre­
   lation between beliefs and behavior (recall Popper the man) .The
   difference between me and those I ridicule is that I try to be aware
   of it.No matter how long I study and try to understand probabil­
   ity, my emotions will respond to a different set of calculations,
   those that my unintelligent genes want me to handle. If my brain
   can tell the difference between noise and signal, my heart cannot.
       Such unintelligent behavior does not just cover probability and
   randomness. I do not think I am reasonable enough to avoid get­
   ting angry when a discourteous driver blows his horn at me for
   being one nanosecond late after a traffic light turns green. I am
   fully aware that such anger is self-destructive and offers no bene­
   fit, and that if I were to develop anger for every idiot around me
   doing something of the sort, I would be long dead.These small
   daily emotions are not rational. But we need them to function
   properly.We are designed to respond to hostility with hostility. I
   have enough enemies to add some spice to my life, but I some­
   times wish I had a few more (I rarely go to the movies and need
   the entertainment) .Life would be unbearably bland if we had no
   enemies on whom to waste efforts and energy.
       The good news is that there are tricks.· One such trick is to
                      WAX I N M Y E A R S   223


avoid eye contact (through the rearview mirror) with other per­
sons in such traffic encounters.Why? Because when you gaze into
someone's eyes, a different part of your brain, the more emotional
one, is activated and engaged as the result of the interaction. I try
to imagine that the other person is a Martian, rather than a human
being. It works sometimes-but it works best when the person
presents the appearance of being from a different species.How? I
am an avid road cyclist. Recently, as I was riding along with other
cyclists, slowing down traffic in a rural area, a small woman in a
giant sports utility vehicle opened her window and heaped curses
at us.Not only did it not upset me but I did not even interrupt my
thoughts to pay attention. When I am on my bicycle, people in
large trucks become a variety of dangerous animals, capable of
threatening me but incapable of making me angry.
   I have, like anyone with strong opinions, a collection of critics
among finance academics and economists, annoyed by my attacks
on their misuse of probability and unhappy about my branding
them as pseudoscientists. I am incapable of taming my emotions
when reading their comments. T he best I can do is just not read
them. Likewise with journalists. Not reading their discussions of
markets spares me plenty of emotional expenditure. I will do the
same with unsolicited comments on this book.Wax in my ears.
                                                                  '..>{

What is the mechanism that should convince authors to avoid
reading comments on their work, except for those they solicit
from specified persons for whom they have intellectual respect?
T he mechanism is a probabilistic method called conditional infor­
mation: Unless the source of the statement has extremely high
qualifications, the statement will be more revealing of the author
than the information intended by him. T his applies, of course, to
matters of judgment.A book review, good or bad, can be far more
                        224   WA X I N M Y E A R S


descriptive of the reviewer than informational about the book it­
self This mechanism I also call Wittgenstein's ruler: Unless you
have confidence in the rnler's reliability, if you use a rnler to measure
a table you may also be using the table to measure the rnler. The less
you trust the ruler's reliability (in prob ability called the prior) , the
more information you are getting about the ruler and the less
about the table. The point extends way beyond information and
probability. This conditionality of information is central in episte­
mology, probability, even in studies of consciousness. We will see
later extensions with "ten sigma" problems.
   The point carries practical implications: The information from
an anonymous reader on Amazon.com is all about the person,
while that of a qualified person, is going to be all about the book.
This plays equally in court: Take the 0. J. Simpson trial once again.
One of the jurors said, "There was not enough blood," meaning to
assess the statistical evidence of what was offered: Such statement
reveals very little about the statistical evidence as compared with
what it shows about the author of the statement's ability to make
a valid inference. Had the j uror been a forensic expert, the ratio of
information would have tilted the other way.
   The problem is that while such reasoning is central to my think­
ing, my brain knows it though not my heart: My emotional system
does not understand Wittgenstein 's ruler. I can offer the following
evidence: A compliment is always pleasant, regardless of its au­
thorship-something manipulators know rather well. Likewise
with book reviews or comments on my risk-management strategy.

Recall that the accomplishment from which I derive the most
pride is my weaning myself from television and the news media. I
am currently so weaned that it actually costs me more energy to
watch television than to perform any other activity, like, say, writ-
                      WAX I N M Y l: AR S   225


ing this book. But this did not come without tricks.Without tricks
I would not escape the toxicity of the information age.In the trad­
ing room of my company, I have the television set turned on all
day with the financial news channel CNBC staging commentator
after commentator and CEO after CEO murdering rigor all day
long.What is the trick? I have the volume turned completely off
Why? Because when the television set is silent, the babbling per­
son looks ridiculous, exactly the opposite effect as when the sound
is on. One sees a person with moving lips and contortions in his
facial muscles, taking themselves seriously-but no sound comes
out.We are visually but not auditorily intimidated, which causes a
dissonance. The speaker's face expresses some excitement, but
since no sound comes out, the exact opposite is conveyed.This is
the sort of contrast the philosopher Henri Bergson had in mind in
his Treatise on Laughter, with his famous description of the gap be­
tween the seriousness of a gentleman about to walk on a banana
skin and the comical aspect of the situation. Television pundits
lose their intimidating effect; they even look ridiculous.They seem     _·,<_
to be excited about something terribly unimportant. Suddenly
pundits become clowns, which is a reason the writer Graham
Greene refused to go on television.
  I had this idea of stripping people of language while, on a trip, I
listened (while brutally jet-lagged) to a speech in Cantonese, a lan­
guage I do not understand, without the benefit of translation.
Since I had no possible clue about his subject, the animated orator
lost a large share of his dignity. The idea came to me that perhaps
I could use a built-in bias, here prejudice, to offset another built­
in bias, our predisposition to take information seriously. It seems
to work.
   This part, the conclusion of this book, presents the human as­
pect of dealing with uncertainty.I have personally failed in achiev­
ing a general insulation from randomness, but I have managed a
few tricks.

       irst, a flashback in time to my early days as a trader in New
       York. Early in my career, I worked at Credit Suisse First
       Boston, then located in the middle of the block between
Fifty-second and Fifty-third streets, between Madison and Park
Avenue. It was called a Wall Street firm, in spite of its Midtown lo­
cation-I used to claim to work "on Wall Street " in spite of having
been lucky enough to set foot only twice on the physical Wall
Street, one of the most repulsive areas I have visited east of
Newark, New Jersey.
   Then, in my twenties, I lived in a book-choked (but otherwise
        G A M B L E: R S ' T I C K S A N D P I G E: O N S I N A B O X   227


rather bare) apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side.The bare­
ness was not ideological; it was simply because I never managed to
enter a furniture store, as I would eventually stop at a bookstore
along the way and haul bags of books instead.As can be expected,
the kitchen was devoid of any form of food and utensils, save for a
defective espresso machine, as I learned to cook only very recently
( even then ... ) .
  I went to work every morning in a yellow cab, which dropped
me off at the corner of Park Avenue and Fifty-third Street. Cab
drivers in New York City are known to be rather untamed and uni­
versally unfamiliar with the geography of the place, but, on occa­
sion, one can find a cab driver who is both unacquainted with the
city and skeptical of the universality of the laws of arithmetic. One
day I had the misfortune (or perhaps the fortune, as we will see)
to ride with a driver who did not seem capable of handling any
language known to me, which includes taxi-cab English.I tried to
help him navigate south between Seventy-fourth Street and Fifty­
third Street, but he stubbornly continued the journey an addi­
tional block south, forcing me to use the Fifty-second Street
entrance.That day, my trading portfolio made considerable profits,
owing to considerable turmoil in currencies; it was then the best
day of my young career.
   The next day, as usual, I hailed a cab from the comer of Seventy­
fourth Street and Third Avenue.The previous driver was nowhere
in sight, perhaps deported back to the old country. Too bad; I was
gripped with the unexplainable desire to pay him back for the
favor he had done me and surprise him with a gigantic tip.Then I
caught myself instructing the new cab driver to take me to the
northeast corner of Fifty-second Street and Park Avenue, exactly
where I was dropped off the day before. I was taken aback by my
own words .. .but it was too late.
  When I looked at my reflection in the elevator's mirror, it
dawned on me that I wore the exact same tie as the day before-
                           228   W A X I N M Y £ AR S


     with the coffee stains from the previous day's fracas (my only ad­
     diction is to coffee) .There was someone in me who visibly be­
     lieved in a strong causal link between my use of the entrance, my
     choice of tie, and the previous day's market behavior. I was dis­
     turbed for acting like a fake, like an actor playing some role that
     was not his.I felt that I was an impostor. On the one hand, I talked
     like someone with strong scientific standards, a probabilist focused
     on his craft.On the other, I had closed superstitions just like one
     of these blue-collar pit traders. Would I have to go buy a horo­
     scope next?
         A little brooding revealed that my life until then had been gov­
     erned by mild superstitions, me the expert in options, the dispas­
     sionate calculator of probabilities, a rational trader] It was not the
     first time that I had acted on mild superstitions of a harmless nature,
     which I believed were instilled in me by my Eastern Mediterranean
     roots: One does not grab the salt shaker from the hand of another
     person risking a falling out; one is to knock on wood upon receiving
     a compliment; plus many other Levantine beliefs passed on for a few
     dozen centuries. But like many things that brew and spread around
     the ancient pond, these beliefs I had taken with a fluctuating mixture
     of solemnity and mistrust.We consider them more like rituals than
     truly important actions meant to stave off undesirable turns of the
     goddess Fortuna-superstitions can instill some poetry in daily life.
         The worrying part was that it was the first time that I noticed
..y·
     superstitions creeping into my professional life. My profession is
     to act like an insurance company, stringently computing the odds
     based on well-defined methods, taking advantage of other people
     when they are less rigorous, get blinded by some "analysis, " or act
     with the belief that they are chosen by destiny. But there was too
     much randomness flooding my occupation.
         I detected the rapid accumulation of what are called "gamblers'
     ticks " surreptitiously developing in my behavior-though minute
     and barely detectable. Until then these small ticks had escaped
     me.My mind seemed to be constantly trying to detect a statistical
        G A M B L ER S ' T I C K S A N D P I G EO N S I N A B O X   229


connection between some of my facial expressions and the out­
come of events.For example, my income started to increase after
I discovered my slight nearsightedness and started wearing glasses.
Although glasses were not quite necessary, nor even useful, except
for night driving, I kept them on my nose as I unconsciously acted
as if I believed in the association between performance and
glasses.To my brain such statistical association was as spurious as
it can get, owing to the reduced sample size (here a single in­
stance), yet this native statistical instinct did not seem to benefit
from my expertise in hypothesis testing.
   Gamblers are known to develop some behavioral distortions as
a result of some pathological association between a betting out­
come and some physical move. "Gambler " is about the most
derogatory term that could be used in my derivatives profession.
As an aside, gambling to me is best defined as an activity where the
agent gets a thrill when confronting a random outcome, regardless
of whether he has the odds stacked in his favor or against him.
Even when the odds are clearly stacked against the gambler, he
sometimes transcends the odds by believing that destiny selected
him in some manner. This shows in the very sophisticated people
one meets in casinos where they normally should not be found. I
even ran into world-class probability experts who had a gambling
habit on the side, throwing all of their knowledge to the wind. For
example, a former colleague of mine, one of the most intelligent
people I have ever met, frequently went to Las Vegas, and seemed
to be such a turkey that the casino provided him With compli­
mentary luxury suites and transportation. He even consulted a
fortune teller prior to taking large trading positions and tried to
get reimbursed by our employer.


         T M E SKINNER P IGEON E X P ERI M EN T

At twenty-five, I was totally ignorant o f the behavioral sciences. I
had been fooled by my education and culture into believing that
                      230   WAX I N M Y E AR S


my superstitions were cultural, and that, consequently, they could
be shed through the exercise of so-called reason.Taken at the gen­
eral level of society, modern life would eliminate them as science
and logic would enter. But in my case, I was over time getting
more sophisticated intellectually, but the floodgates of random­
ness were bursting and I was becoming more superstitious.
   T hese superstitions needed to be biological-but I was brought
up in an era when the dogma was that it was nurture, rarely na­
ture, that was the culprit.Clearly, there was nothing cultural about
my link between my wearing glasses and a random market out­
come. T here was nothing cultural in my link between my use of
entrance and my performance as a trader.T here was nothing cul­
tural in my wearing the same tie as the day before. Something in
us has not developed properly over the past thousand years and I
was dealing with the remnant of our old brain.
   To probe the point further, we need to look at such formations
of causal associations in the lower forms of life.The famous Har­
vard psychologist B. F. Skinner constructed a box for rats and pi­
geons, equipped with a switch that the pigeon can operate by
pecking. In addition, an electrical mechanism delivers food into
the box. Skinner designed the box in order to study more general
properties of the behavior of a collection of nonhumans, but it was
in 194 8 that he had the brilliant idea of ignoring the lever and fo­
cusing on the food delivery. He programmed it to deliver food at
random to the famished birds.
   He saw quite astonishing behavior on the part of the birds; they
developed an extremely sophisticated rain-dance type of behavior
in response to their ingrained statistical machinery. One bird
swung its head rhythmically against a specific corner of the box,
others spun their heads counterclockwise; literally all of the birds
developed a specific ritual that progressively became hardwired
into their mind as linked to their feeding.
   This problem has a more worrying extension; we are not made
        G A M B L ER S ' T I C K S A N D P I G E O N S I N A B O X   2 31


to view things as independent from each other. When viewing two             ';If­
events A and B, it is hard not to assume that A causes B, B causes
A, or both cause each other. Our bias is immediately to establish a
causal link. While to a budding trader this results in hardly any
worse costs than a few pennies in cab fare, it can draw the scien-
tist into spurious inference.For it is harder to act as if one were ig­
norant than as if one were smart; scientists know that it is
emotionally harder to reject a hypothesis than to accept it (what
are called type I and type II errors)-quite a difficult matter when
we have such sayings as felix qui po·"tuit cognoscere causas (happy is
he who understands what is behind things) . It is very hard for us
to just shut up.We are not cut out for it. Popper or not, we take
things too seriously.


                    P I-I ILOS TRATUS REDU X

I offered no solution to the problem of statistical inference at a
low resolution. I discussed in Chapter 3 the technical difference
between noise and meaning-but it is time to discuss the execu­
tion.The Greek philosopher Pyrrho, who advocated a life of equa­
nimity and indifference, was criticized for failing to keep his
composure during a critical circumstance (he was chased by an
ox) . His answer was that he found it sometimes difficult to rid
himself of his humanity. If Pyrrho cannot stop being human, I do
not see why the rest of us should resemble the rational man who
acts perfectly under uncertainty as propounded by economic the­
ory.I discovered that much of the rationally obtained results using
my computations of the various probabilities do not register
deeply enough to impact my own conduct.In other words, I acted
like the doctor in Chapter 11 who knew of the 2% probability of
the disease, but somehow unwittingly treated the patient as if the
ailment had a 9 5 % probability of being there.My brain and my in­
stinct were not acting in concert.

              The details are as follows. As a rational trader (all traders boast
          so) I believe, as I discussed before, that there is a difference be­
          tween noise and signal, and that noise needs to be ignored while a
r
){
          signal needs to be taken seriously. I use elementary (but robust)
          methods that allow me to calculate the expected noise and signal
          composition of any fluctuation in my trading performance.For ex-
          ample, after registering a profit of $ 100, 000 on a given strategy, I
          may assign a 2% probability to the hypothesis of the strategy being
          profitable and 98% probability to the hypothesis that the per­
          formance may be the result of mere noise. A gain of $ 1 million on
          the other hand, certifies that the strategy is a profitable one, with
          a 99% probability.A rational person would act accordingly in the
          selection of strategies, and set his emotions in accordance with his
          results.Yet I have experienced leaps of joy over results that I knew
          were mere noise, and bouts of unhappiness over results that did
          not carry the slightest degree of statistical significance. I cannot
          help it, but I am emotional and derive most of my energy from my
          emotions. So the solution does not reside in taming my heart.
              Since my heart does not seem to agree with my brain, I need to
          take serious action to avoid making irrational trading decisions,
          namely, by denying myself access to my performance report unless
 . :.::
 \;  [)   it hits a predetermined threshold. This is no different from the di-
          vorce between my brain and my appetite when it comes to the
          consumption of chocolate.I generally deal with it by ascertaining
          that there are no chocolate boxes under my trading desk.
              One of the most irritating conversations I've had is with people
          who lecture me on how I should behave. Most of us know pretty
          much how we should behave. It is the execution that is the prob­
          lem, not the absence of knowledge. I am tired of the moralizing
          slow-thinkers who pound me with platitudes like I should floss
          daily, eat my regular apple, and visit the gym outside of the New
          Year's resolution.In the markets the recommendation would be to
          ignore the noise component in the performance.We need tricks to
        G A M B L ERS ' T I C K S A N D P I G EO N S I N A B O X   2 33


get us there but before that we need to accept the fact that we are
mere animals in need of lower forms of tricks, not lectures.
   Finally, I consider myself lucky for not having a cigarette addic­
tion. For the best way to understand how we could be rational in
our perception of the risks and probabilities and, at the same time,
be foolish while acting on them would be to have a conversation
with a cigarette smoker. For few cigarette smokers remain un­
aware of the lung cancer rates in their population. If you remain
unconvinced, take a look at the huddling smoking crowd outside
the service entrance of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center in New York City's Upper East Side.You will see dozens of
cancer nurses (and, perhaps, doctors) standing outside the en­
trance with a cigarette in hand as hopeless patients are wheeled in
for their treatments.

an alternative outcome, cause, or motive.Recall that mathematics i
is a tool to meditate, not compute. Again, let us go back to the
elders for more guidance-for probabilities were always consid­
ered by them as nothing beyond a subjective, and fluid, measure
of beliefs.

Around I 5 5 B.C., the Greek postclassical philosopher Carneades
of Cyrene came to Rome as one of the three Athenian ambassa­
dors who came to beg the Roman Senate for a political favor.A
fine had been levied against the citizens of their city, and they
wanted to convince Rome that it was unfair. Carneades repre­
sented the Academy, the same argumentative open-air institution
where three centuries before, Socrates drove his interlocutors to
murder him just to get some respite from his arguments. It was
now called the New Academy, was no less argumentative, and had
the reputation of being the hotbed of skepticism in the ancient
world.
   On the much anticipated day of his oration, he stood up and
delivered a brilliantly argued harangue in praise of justice and how
devolving it should be at the top of our motives.The Roman audi­
ence was spellbound. It was not just his charisma; the audience
was swayed by the strength of the arguments, the eloquence of the
thought, the purity of the language, and the energy of the speaker.
But that was not the point he wanted to drill.
   The next day, Carneades came back, stood up, and established
the doctrine of uncertainty of knowledge in the most possibly
convincing way. How? By proceeding to contradict and refute
with no less swaying arguments what he had established so con­
vincingly the day before. He managed to persuade the very same
audience and in the same spot that justice should be way down on
the list of motivations for human undertakings.
   Now the bad news. Cato the elder (the "censor ") was among
the audience, already quite old, and no more tolerant than he had
been during his office of censor.Enraged, he persuaded the Senate
to send the three ambassadors packing lest their argumentative
spirit muddle the spirit of the youth of the Republic and weaken
the military culture.(Cato had banned during his office of censor-

       ship all Greek rhetoricians from establishing residence in Rome.
       He was too much a no-nonsense type of person to accept their in­
       trospective expansions.)
          Carneades was not the first skeptic in classical times, nor was he
         the first to teach us the true notion of probability. But this incident
         remains the most spectacular in its impact on generations of
         rhetoricians and thinkers. Carneades was not merely a skeptic; he
         was a dialectician, someone who never committed himself to any of
         the premises from which he argued, or to any of the conclusions he
         drew from them.He stood all his life against arrogant dogma and
         belief in one sole truth. Few credible thinkers rival Carneades in
         their rigorous skepticism (a class that would include the medieval
         Arab philosopher Al Gazali, Hume, and Kant-but only Popper
                                    ,.
         came to elevate his skepticism to an all-encompassing scientific
         methodology). As the skeptics' main teaching was that nothing
   � could be accepted with certainty, conclusions of various degrees of
...._� , probability could be formed, and these supplied a guide to conduct.
            Stepping further back in time and searching for the first known
         uses of probabilistic thinking in history, we find it harks back to
         sixth-century (B.C.) Greek Sicily.There, the notion of probability
         was used in a legal framework by the very first rhetoricians who,
         when arguing a case, needed to show the existence of a doubt con­
         cerning the certainty of the accusation.The first known rhetorician
         was a Syracusean named Korax, who engaged in teaching people
         how to argue from probability.At the core of his method was the
         notion of the most probable. For example, the ownership of a piece
         of land, in the absence of further information and physical evi­
         dence, should go to the person after whose name it is best known.
         One of his indirect students, Gorgias, took this method of argu­
         mentation to Athens, where it flourished.It is the establishment of
         such most probable notions that taught us to view the possible con­
         tingencies as distinct and separable events with probabilities at­
         tached to each one of them.

               Probability, the Child of Skepticism
Until the Mediterranean basin was dominated with monotheism,
which led to the belief in some form of uniqueness of the truth (to
be superceded later by episodes of communism) , skepticism had
gained currency among many major thinkers-and certainly per­
meated the world.The Romans did not have a religion per se; they
were too tolerant to accept a given truth. Theirs was a collection
of a variety of flexible and syncretic superstitions.I will not get too
theological, except to say that we had to wait for a dozen centuries
in the Western world to espouse critical thinking again.Indeed, for
some strange reason during the Middle Ages, Arabs were critical
thinkers (through their postclassical philosophical tradition) when
Christian thought was dogmatic; then, after the Renaissance, the
roles mysteriously reversed.
   One author from antiquity who provides us evidence of such
thinking is the garrulous Cicero. He preferred to be guided by
probability than allege with certainty-very handy, some said, be­
cause it allowed him to contradict himself This may be a reason
for us, who have learned from Popper how to remain self-critical,
to respect him more, as he did not hew stubbornly to an opiniorr:f---­
for the mere fact that he had voiced it in the past. Indeed your av­
erage literature professor would fault him for his contradictions
and his change of mind.
   It was not until modern times that such desire to be free from
our own past statements emerged. Nowhere was it made more
eloquently than in rioting student graffiti in Paris. The student
movement that took place in France in 1968, with the youth no
doubt choking under the weight of years of having to sound intel­
ligent and coherent, produced, among other jewels, the following
demand:


   We demand the right to contradict ourselves!

         MONSIEUR DE NORPOIS' OPINIONS

Modern times provide us with a depressing story.Self-contradiction
is made culturally to be shameful, a matter that can prove disastrous
in science.Marcel Proust's novel In Search of Time Lost features a
semiretired diplomat, Marquis de Norpois, who, like all diplomats
before the advent of the fax machine, was a socialite who spent con­
siderable time in salons.The narrator of the novel sees Monsieur de
Norpois openly contradicting himself on some issue (some prewar
rapprochement between France and Germany) .When reminded of
his previous position, Monsieur de Norpois did not seem to recall it.
Proust reviles him:

  Monsieur de Norpois was not lying. He had just forgotten . One
  forgets rather quickly what one has not thought about with
  depth , what has been dictated to you by imitation, by the pas­
  sions surrounding you.These change, and with them so do your
  memories. Even more than diplomats, politicians do not re­
  member opinions they had at some point in their lives and their
  fibbings are more attributab le to an excess of ambition than a
  lack of memory.

Monsieur de Norpois is made to be ashamed of the fact that he ex­
pressed a different opinion.Proust did not consider that the diplo­
mat might have changed his mind.We are supposed to be faithful
to our opinions.One becomes a traitor otherwise.
   Now I hold that Monsieur de Norpois should be a trader.One of
the best traders I have ever encountered in my life, Nigel Babbage,
has the remarkable attribute of being completely free of any path
dependence in his beliefs.He exhibits absolutely no embarrassment '�
buying a given currency on a pure impulse, when only hours ago he
might have voiced a strong opinion as to its future weakness.What
changed his mind? He does not feel obligated to explain it.

      The public person most visibly endowed with such a trait is
    George Soros. One of his strengths is that he revises his opinion
    rather rapidly, without the slightest embarrassment . The following
    anecdote illustrates Soros' ability to reverse his opinion in a flash .
    The French playboy trader Jean-Manuel Rozan discusses the fol­
    lowing episode in his autobiography (disguised as a novel in order
    to avoid legal bills) . The protagonist (Rozan) used to play tennis in
    the Hamptons on Long Island with Georgi Saulos, an "older man
    with a funny accent," and sometimes engage in discussions about
    the market, not initially knowing how important and influential
    Saulos truly was. One weekend, Saulos exhibited in his discussion
    a large amount of bearishness, with a complicated series of argu­
    ments that the narrator could not follow. He was obviously short
    the market. A few days later, the market rallied violently, making
    record highs. The protagonist worried about Saulos, and asked him
    at their subsequent tennis encounter if he was hurt. "We made a
    killing," Saulos said . "I changed my mind. We covered and went
    very long."
       It was this very trait that, a few years later, affected Rozan
    negatively and almost cost him a career. Soros gave Rozan in the
    late 1 980s $20 million to speculate with ( a sizeable amount at
    the time), which allowed him to start a trading company (I was
    almost dragged into it) . A few days later, as Soros was visiting
    Paris, they discussed markets over lunch . Rozan saw Soros be­
    coming distant . He then completely pulled the money, offering
    no explanation . What characterizes real speculators like Soros
         from the rest is that their activities are devoid of path depend-
         ence. They re totally free from their past actions . Every day is a

                         Path Dependence of Beliefs
    There is a simple test to define path dependence of beliefs (econ­
    omists have a manifestation of it called the endowment effect) .

      Say you own a painting you bought for $20,000, and owing to rosy
      conditions in the art market, it is now worth $4 0, 000. If you
      owned no painting, would you still acquire it at the current price?
      If you would not, then you are said to be married to your position.
      There is no rational reason to keep a painting you would not buy
      at its current market rate-only an emotional investment. Many
      people get married to their ideas all the way to the grave. Beliefs
 •    are said to be path dependent if the sequence of ideas is such that
,4(-
 / ' the first one dominates.
          There are reasons to believe that, for evolutionary purposes, we
      may be programmed to build a loyalty to ideas in which we have
      invested time. Think about the consequences of being a good
      trader outside of the market activity, and deciding every morning
      at 8 a.m.whether to keep the spouse or part with him or her for a
      better emotional investment elsewhere. Or think of a politician
      who is so rational that, during a campaign, he changes his mind on
      a given matter because of fresh evidence and abruptly switches
      political parties. That would make rational investors who evaluate
      trades in a proper way a genetic oddity-perhaps a rare mutation.
      Researchers found that purely rational behavior on the part of hu­

      to propagate our genes, so we do with ideas. An academic who be­
      came famous for espousing an opinion is not going to voice any­
      thing that can possibly devalue his own past work and kill years of
      investment.People who switch parties become traitors, renegades,
      or, worst of all, apostates (those who abandoned their religion
      were punishable by death).

There is another story of probability other than the one I intro­
duced with Carneades and Cicero. Probability entered mathematics
with gambling theory, and stayed there as a mere computational de­
vice. Recently, an entire industry of "risk measurers" emerged, spe­
cializing in the application of these probability methods to assess
risks in the social sciences. Certainly, the odds in games where the
rules are clearly and explicitly defined are computable and the risks
consequently measured. But not in the real world. For mother na­
ture did not endow us with clear rules.The game is not a deck of
cards (we do not even know how many colors there are).But some­
how people "measure" risks, particularly if they are paid for it.I have
already discussed Hume's problem of induction and the occurrence
of black swans. Here I introduce the scientific perpetrators.     �
   Recall that I have waged a war against the charlatanism of some
prominent financial economists for a long time. The points are as
follows. One Harry Markowitz received something called the
Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics (which in fact is not even a
Nobel Prize, as it is granted by the Swedish Central Bank in honor
of Alfred Nobel-it was never in the will of the famous man) .
What is his achievement? Creating an elaborate method of com­
puting future risk if one knows future uncertainty; in other words,
if the world had clearly defined rules one picks up in a rulebook of
the kind one finds in a Monopoly package. Now, I explained the
point to a cab driver who laughed at the fact that someone ever
thought that there was any scientific method to understanding
markets and predicting their attributes. Somehow when one gets
involved in financial economics, owing to the culture of the field,
one becomes likely to forget these basic facts (pressure to publish
to keep one's standing among the other academics) .
   An immediate result of Dr.Markowitz's theory was the near col­
lapse of the financial system in the summer of 1 998 (as we saw in
                       242   WA X I N M Y EAR S


Chapters l and 5) by Long Term Capital Management ("LTCM"), a
Greenwich, Connecticut, fund that had for principals two of Dr.
Markowitz's colleagues, "Nobels" as well.They are Ors. Robert Mer­
ton (the one in Chapter 3 trouncing Shiller) and Myron Scholes.
Somehow they thought they could scientifically "measure" their
risks.They made absolutely no allowance in the LT CM episode for
the possibility of their not understanding markets and their meth­
ods being wrong. That was not a hypothesis to be considered.I hap­
pen to specialize in black swans. Suddenly I started getting some
irritating fawning respect.Ors.Merton and Scholes helped put your
humble author on the map and caused interest in his ideas.The fact
that these "scientists" pronounced the catastrophic losses a "ten
sigma" event reveals a Wittgenstein's ruler problem: Someone say­
ing this is a ten sigma either (a) knows what he is talking about with
near perfection (the prior assumption is that it has one possibility of
being unqualified in several billion billions), knows his probabilities,
and it is an event that happens once every several times the history
of the universe; or (b) just does not know what he is talking about
when he talks about probability (with a high degree of certainty),
and it is an event that has a probability higher than once every sev­
eral times the history of the universe. I will let the reader pick from
these two mutually exclusive interpretations which one is more
plausible.
    Note that the conclusions also reflect on the Nobel committee
who sanctified the ideas of the gentlemen involved: Conditional on
these events, did they make a mistake or were these events unusual?
Is the Nobel committee composed of infallible judges? Where is
Charles Sanders Peirce to talk to us about papal infallibilism? Where
is Karl Popper to warn us against taking science-and scientific in­
stitutions-seriously? In a few decades will we look upon the Nobel
economics committee with the same smirk as when we look at the
respected "scientific" establishments of the Middle Ages that pro­
moted (against all observational evidence) the idea that the heart
               CAR N EA D E S C O M E S T O R O M E   243


was a center of heat? We have been getting things wrong in the past
and we laugh at our past institutions; it is time to figure out that we    �..,..

should avoid enshrining the present ones.
                                                                          1


   One would think that when scientists make a mistake, they de­
velop a new science that incorporates what has been learned from
it. When academics blow up trading, one would expect them to
integrate such information in their theories and make some heroic
statement to the effect that they were wrong, but that now they
have learned something about the real world.Nothing of the sort.
Instead they complain about the behavior of their counterparts in
the market who pounced on them like vultures, thus exacerbating
their downfall. Accepting what has happened, clearly the coura­
geous thing to do, would invalidate the ideas they have built
throughout an entire academic career.All of the principals who
engaged in a discussion of the LTCM events partook of a mas­
querade of science by adducing ad hoc explanations and putting
the blame on a rare event (problem of induction: How did they
know it was a rare event?) . They spent their energy defending
themselves rather than trying to make a buck with what they
learned. Again, compare them with Soros, who walks around
telling whoever has the patience to listen to him that he is fallible.
My lesson from Soros is to start every meeting at my boutique by
convincing everyone that we are a bunch of idiots who know
nothing and are mistake-prone, but happen to be endowed with               1
the rare privilege of knowing it.                                 • -3>'-
   The scientist's behavior while facing the refutation of his ideas r
has been studied in depth as part of the so-called attribution bias.
You attribute your successes to skills, but your failures to random­
ness.This explains why these scientists attributed their failures to
the "ten sigma " rare event, indicative of the thought that they were
right but that luck played against them. Why? It is a human
heuristic that makes us actually believe so in order not to kill our
self-esteem and keep us going against adversity.

   We have known about this wedge between performance and
self-assessment since I 954, with Meehl's study of experts compar­
ing their perceived abilities to their statistical ones. It shows a sub­
stantial discrepancy between the objective record of people's
success in prediction tasks and the sincere beliefs of these people
about the quality of their performance.The attribution bias has an­
other effect: It gives people the illusion of being better at what
they do, which explains the findings that 80 to 90% of people think
that they are above the average (and the median) in many things.

I conclude with the following saddening remark about scientists in
the soft sciences. People confuse science and scientists. Science is
great, but individual scientists are dangerous. They are human;
they are marred by the biases humans have. Perhaps even more.
For most scientists are hard-headed, otherwise they would not de­
rive the patience and energy to perform the Herculean tasks asked
of them, like spending eighteen hours a day perfecting their doc­
toral thesis.
   A scientist may be forced to act like a cheap defense lawyer
rather than a pure seeker of the truth. A doctoral thesis is "de­
fended" by the applicant; it would be a rare situation to see the
student change his mind upon being supplied with a convincing
argument. But science is better than scientists. It was said that sci­
ence evolves from funeral to funeral. After the LTCM collapse, a
new financial economist will emerge, who will integrate such
knowledge into his science. He will be resisted by the older ones,
but, again, they will be much closer to their funeral date than he.

    Montherlant's death. Stoicism is not the stiff upper lip, but
    the illusion of victory of man against randomness. It is so
    easy to be heroic. Randomness and personal elegance.




            hen the classicist aristocratic French writer Henry de
            Montherlant was told that he was about to lose his
            eyesight to a degenerative disease, he found it most
appropriate to take his own life.Such is the end that becomes a
classicist.Why? Because the stoic's prescription was precisely to
elect what one can do to control one's destiny in front of a ran­
dom outcome.At the end, one is allowed to choose between no
life at all and what one is given by destiny; we always have an
option against uncertainty. But such an attitude is not limited to
stoics; both competing sects in the ancient world, stoicism and
                       246   WAX I N M Y EAR S


Epicureanism , recommended such control (the difference be­
tween the two resides in minor technicalities-neither phi­
losophies meant then what is- commonly accepted today in
middlebrow culture).
   Being a hero does not necessarily mean such an extreme act as
getting killed in battle or taking one's life-the latter is only
recommended in a narrow set of circumstances and considered
cowardly otherwise. Having control over randomness can be ex­
pressed in the manner in which one acts in the small and the
large. Recall that epic heroes were judged by their actions, not by
the results. No matter how sophisticated our choices, how good
we are at dominating the odds, randomness will have the last
word. We are left only with dignity as a solution-dignity defined
as the execution of a protocol of behavior that does not depend
on the immediate circumstance. It may not be the optimal one,
but it certainly is the one that makes us feel best. Grace under
pressure, for example. Or in deciding not to toady up to someone,
whatever the reward. Or in fighting a duel to save face. Or in sig­
naling to a prospective mate during courtship : "Listen, I have a
crush on you; I am obsessed with you, but I will not do a thing to
compromise my dignity. Accordingly, the slightest snub and you
will never see me again."
   This last chapter will discuss randomness from a totally new
angle; philosophical but not the hard philosophy of science and
epistemology as we saw in Part I with the black swan problem. It is
a more archaic, softer type of philosophy, the various guidelines
that the ancients had concerning the manner in which a man of
virtue and dignity deals with randomness-there was no real reli­
gion at the time (in the modern sense) . It is worthy of note that be­
fore the spread of what can be best called Mediterranean
monotheism, the ancients did not believe enough in their prayers
to influence the course of destiny. Their world was dangerous,
fraught with invasions and reversals of fortune. They needed sub-
              B A C C I--I U S A B A N D O N S A N T O N Y   24 7


stantial prescriptions in dealing with randomness.It is such beliefs
that we will outline next.

If a stoic were to visit us, he would feel represented by the follow­
ing poem.To many (sophisticated) lovers of poetry, one of the
greatest poets who ever breathed is C. P. Cavafy. Cavafy was an
Alexandrian Greek civil servant with a Turkish or Arabic last name
who wrote almost a century ago in a combination of classical and
modern Greek a lean poetry that seems to have eluded the last fif­
teen centuries of Western literature.Greeks treasure him like their
national monument. Most of his poems take place in Syria (his
Grecosyrian poems initially drew me to him), Asia Minor, and
Alexandria. Many people believe it worth learning formal semi­
classical Greek just to savor his poems. Somehow their acute
aestheticism stripped of sentimentality provides a relief from cen­
turies of mawkishness in poetry and drama.He provides a classical
relief for those of us who were subjected to the middle-class­
valued melodrama as represented by Dickens's novels, romantic
poetry, and Verdi's operas.
   I was surprised to hear that Maurice Tempelsman, last consort
of Jackie Kennedy Onassis, read Cavafy's valedictory "Apoleipein o
Theos Antonion " ("The God Abandons Antony " ) at her funeral.
The poem addresses Marc Antony, who has just lost the battle
against Octavius and was forsaken by Bacchus, the god who until
then had protected him. It is one of the most elevating poems I
have ever read, beautiful because it was the epitome of such dig­
nified aestheticism-and because of the gentle but edifying tone
of the voice of the narrator advising a man who had just received
a crushing reversal of fortune.
   The poem addresses Antony, now defeated and betrayed (ac­
cording to legend, even his horse deserted him to go to his enemy
                       248    W A X I N M V E ARS


Octavius) .It asks him to just bid her farewell, Alexandria the city
that is leaving him. It tells him not to mourn his luck, not to enter
denial, not to believe that his ears and eyes are deceiving him.
Antony, do not degrade yourself with empty hopes.Antony,

   Just listen while shaken by emotion but not with the coward's im­
  ploration and complaints.


While shaken with emotion. No stiff upper lip. There is nothing
wrong and undignified with emotions-we are cut to have them.
What is wrong is not following the heroic or, at least, the dignified
path.That is what stoicism truly means.It is the attempt by man to
get even with probability. I need not be nasty at all and break the
spell of the poem and its message, but I cannot resist some cyni­
cism.A couple of decades later, Cavafy, while dying of throat can­
cer, did not quite follow the prescription.Deprived of his voice by
the surgeons, he used to randomly enter undignified spells of cry­
ing and cling to his visitors, preventing them from leaving his
death room.
    Some history. I said that stoicism has rather little to do with the
stiff-upper-lip notion that we believe it means. Started as an intel­
lectual movement in antiquity by a Phoenician Cypriot, Zeno of
Kition, it developed by Roman time into a life based on a system
of virtues-in the ancient sense when virtue meant virtu, the sort of
belief in which virtue is its own reward. There developed a social
model for a stoic person, like the gentlemen in Victorian England.
Its tenets can be summarized as follows: The stoic is a person who
combines the qualities of wisdom, upright dealing, and courage.
The stoic will thus be immune from life's gyrations as he will be
superior to the wounds from some of life's dirty tricks. But things
can be carried to the extreme; the stern Cato found it beneath him
to have human feelings. A more human version can be read in
Seneca's Letters from a Stoic, a soothing and surprisingly readable
               B ACC H U S A B A N D O N S A N T O N Y   249


book that I distribute to my trader friends (Seneca also took his
own life when cornered by destiny).


    RANDO M NESS AND P ERSONAL ELEGAN C E

The reader knows m y opinion on unsolicited advice and sermons
on how to behave in life. Recall that ideas do not truly sink in
when emotions come into play; we do not use our rational brain
outside of classrooms. Self-help books ( even when they are not
written by charlatans) are largely ineffectual. Good, enlightened
(and "friendly") advice and eloquent sermons do not register for
more than a few moments when they go against our wiring. The
interesting thing about stoicism is that it plays on dignity and per­
sonal aesthetics, which are part of our genes. Start stressing per­
sonal elegance at your next misfortune. Exhibit sapere vivere
("know how to live") in all circumstances.                                 �:er.,.

   Dress at your best on your execution day (shave carefully); try to
leave a good impression on the death squad by standing erect and
proud. Try not to play victim when diagnosed with cancer (hide it
from others and only share the information with the doctor-it will
avert the platitudes and nobody will treat you like a victim worthy
of their pity; in addition, the dignified attitude will make both defeat
and victo ry feel equally heroic). Be extremely courteous to your as­
sistant when you lose money (instead of taking it out on him as
many of the traders whom I scorn routinely do). Try not to blame
others for your fate, even if they deserve blame. Never exhibit any
self-pity, even if your significant other bolts with the handsome ski
instructor or the younger aspiring model. Do not complain. If you
suffer from a benign version of the "attitude problem," like one of
my childhood friends, do not start playing nice guy if your business
dries up (he sent a heroic e-mail to his colleagues informing them
"less business, but same attitude"). The only article Lady Fortuna has
no control over is your behavior. Good luck.             J,..

                 Beware the London Traffic Jams
       couple of years after we left him looking at John smoking a
       cigarette with a modicum of schadenfreude, Nero's skepti­
       cism ended up paying off Simultaneously as he beat the 28%
odds, up to the point of complete cure, he made a series of exhila­
rating personal and professional victories. Not only did he end up
sampling the next level of wealth but he got the riches right when
other Wall Street hotshots got poor, which could have allowed him
to buy the goods they owned at very large discounts, if he wanted to.
But he acquired very little, and certainly none of the goods Wall
Streeters usually buy. But Nero did engage in occasional excess.

   Friday afternoon traffic in London can be dreadful. Nero
started spending more time there.He developed an obsession with
traffic jams.One day he spent five hours moving west from his of­
fice in the city of London toward a cottage in the Cotswolds,
where he stayed most weekends. The frustration prompted Nero
to get a helicopter-flying license, through a crash course in Cam­
bridgeshire.He realized that the train was probably an easier solu­
tion to get out of town for the weekend, but he felt the urge for a
pet extravagance. The other result of his frustration was his no less
dangerous commuting on a bicycle between his flat in Kensington
and his office in the city.
   Nero's excessive probability-consciousness in his profession
somehow did not register fully into his treatment of physical risk.
For Nero's helicopter crashed as he was landing it near Battersea
Park on a windy day. He was alone in it.In the end the black swan
got its man.

The higher up the corporate ladder, the higher the compensation
to the individual. This might be justified, as it makes plenty of
sense to pay individuals according to their contributions. How­
ever, and in general (provided we exclude risk-bearing entrepre­
neurs) , the higher up the corporate ladder, the lower the evidence
of such contribution. I call this the inverse rule.
    I will be deriving the point by mere logical arguments. Chap­
ter 2 made the distinction between those skills that are visible
(like the abilities of a dentist) and those that present more diffi­
culty in nailing down, especially when the subject belongs to a
randomness-laden profession (say, one that includes the occa­
sional practice of Russian roulette) .The degree of randomness in
such an activity and our ability to isolate the contribution of the
individual determine the visibility of the skills content. Accord­
ingly, the cook at the company headquarters or the factory
worker will exhibit their direct abilities with minimal uncer­
tainty. These contributions may be modest but they are clearly
definable.A patently incompetent professional cook who cannot
distinguish salt from sugar or who tends to systematically over­
cook the meat would be easily caught, provided the diners have
functioning taste buds.And if he gets it right by luck once, it also
will be hard for him to get it right by sheer chance a second, third,
and a thousandth time.
    Repetitiveness is key for the revelation of skills because of what
I called ergodicity in Chapter 8-the detection of long-term prop­
erties, particularly when these exist.If you bang one million dol­
lars at your next visit to Las Vegas at the roulette table in one
single shot, you will not be able to ascertain from this single out­
come whether the house has the advantage or if you were partic­
ularly out of the gods' favor.If you slice your gamble into a series
of one million bets of one dollar each, the amount you recover will

systematically show the casino's advantage. This is the core of
sampling theory, traditionally called the law of large numbers.
   To view it in another way, consider the difference between
judging on process and judging on results. Lower-ranking persons in
the enterprise are judged on both process and results-in fact,
owing to the repetitive aspect of their efforts, their process con­
verges rapidly to results.But top management is only paid on re­
sult-no matter the process.There seems to be no such thing as a
foolish decision if it results in profits."Money talks, " we are oftent�
                                                                       _,.,,,.,,.,

told. The rest is supposed to be philosophy.
   Now take a peek inside the chief executive suite. Clearly, the
decisions there are not repeatable. CEOs take a small number of
large decisions, more like the person walking into the casino with
a single million-dollar bet. External factors, such as the environ­
ment, play a considerably larger role than with the cook.The link
between the skill of the CEO and the results of the company are
tenuous. By some argument, the boss of the company may be un­
skilled labor but one who presents the necessary attributes of
charisma and the package that makes for good MBA talk.In other
words, he may be subjected to the monkey-on-the-typewriter
problem. There are so many companies doing all kinds of things
that some of them are bound to make "the right decision."
   It is a very old problem. It is just that, with the acceleration of
the power law-style winner-takes-all effects in our environment,
such differences in outcomes are more accentuated, more visible,
and more offensive to people's sense of fairness. In the old days,
the CEO was getting ten to twenty times what the janitor earned.
Today, he can get several thousand times that.
   I am excluding entrepreneurs from this discussion for the obvi­
ous reason: These are people who stuck their necks out for some
idea, and risked belonging to the vast cemetery of those who did
not make it.But CEOs are not entrepreneurs.As a matter a fact,
they are often empty suits. In the "quant " world, the designation
empty suit applies to the category of persons who are good at look-
                                256   P O S T S CR I PT


      ing the part but nothing more.More appropriately, what they have
      is skill in getting promoted within a company rather than pure
      skills in making optimal decisions-we call that "corporate po-
'     litical skill." These are people mostly trained at using PowerPoint
JJ'
� presentations.
          There is an asymmetry, as these executives have almost nothing
      to lose. Assume that two equally charismatic, empty-suit-style twin
      brothers manage to climb the corporate ladder to get two different
      jobs in two different corporations. Assume that they own good­
      looking suits, that they have MBAs, and that they are tall (the only
      truly visible predictor of corporate success is to be taller than aver­
      age).They flip coins in secret and randomly take completely oppo­
      site actions, leading to great failure for one and great success for the
      other.We end up with a mildly wealthy, but fired, executive and his
      extremely wealthy, and still operating, twin brother. The share­
      holder bore the risk; the executives got the reward.
          The prob1em is as old as leadership. Our attribution of heroism
      to those who took crazy decisions but were lucky enough to win
  · shows the aberration-we continue to worship those who won
  J battles and despise those who lost, no matter the reason. I wonder

          I insist that it is not society's problem but that of the investors.
      If shareholders are foolish enough to pay someone $200 million to
      just wear a good-looking suit and ring a bell, as they did with the
      New York Stock Exchange's Richard Grasso in 2003, it is their
      own money they part with, not yours and mine. It is a corporate
      governance issue.
          The situation is not much better in a bureaucratic economy.
      Outside the capitalistic system, presumed talent flows to the gov­
      ernmental positions, where the currency is prestige, power, and so­
      cial rank. There, too, it is distributed disproportionately. The

contributions of civil servants might be even more difficult to
judge than those of the executives of a corporation-and the
scrutiny is smaller. The central banker lowers interest rates, a re­
covery ensues, but we do not know whether he caused it or if he
slowed it down.We can't even know that he didn't destabilize the
economy by increasing the risk of future inflation. He can always
fit a theoretical explanation, but economics is a narrative disci­
pline, and explanations are easy to fit retrospectively.
   The problem may not be incurable. It is just that we need to
                                                                    L
drill into the heads of those who measure the contribution of ex­

holders, in the end, are the ones who are fooled by randomness.

                    Uncertainty and Happiness
Have you ever had a weeknight dinner in New York City with a
suburban commuter? Odds are that the shadow of the schedule
will be imprinted in his consciousness.He will be tightly aware of
the clock, pacing his meal in such a way that he does not miss the
7 :08 because after that one, there are no more express trains and
he would be reduced to taking the 7 : 4 2 local, something that ap­
pears to be very undesirable. He will cut the conversation short
around 6: 58, offer a quick handshake, then zoom out of the
restaurant to catch his train with maximal efficiency. You will also
be stuck with the bill. Since the meal is not finished, and the bill is
not ready, your manners will force you to tell him that it's on you.
You will also finish the cup of decaffeinated skim cappuccino all
alone while staring at his empty seat and wondering why people
get trapped by choice into such a life.
   Now deprive him of his schedule-or randomize the time of
departures of the trains so they no longer obey a fixed and known
                             258   P O S T S CR I PT


    timetable.Given that what is random and what you do not know
    are functionally the same, you do not have to ask the New York
    area Metropolitan Transit Authority to randomize their trains for
    the purpose of the experiment: Just assume that he is deprived of
    knowledge of the various departure times. All he would know is
    that they operate about every, say, thirty-five minutes. What
    would he do under such a scenario? Although you might still end
    up paying for dinner, he would let the meal follow its natural
    course, then leisurely walk to the nearby station, where he would
    have to wait for the next train to show up.The time difference be­
    tween the two situations will be a little more than a quarter of an
    hour. Another way to see the contrast between a known and an
    unknown schedule is to compare his condition to that of another
    diner who has to use the subway to go home, for an equivalent dis­
    tance, but without a known and fixed schedule. Subway riders are
    freer of their schedule, and not just because of the higher fre­
    quency of trains.Uncertainty protects them from themselves.
       Chapter 10 showed, with the illustration of Buridan's donkey,
    that randomness is not always unwelcome.This discussion aims to
    show how some degree of unpredictability (or lack of knowledge)
    can be beneficial to our defective species.A slightly random sched­
    ule prevents us from optimizing and being exceedingly efficient,
    particularly in the wrong things. This little bit of uncertainty
    might make the diner relax and forget the time pressures. He
    would be forced to act as a satisficer instead of a maximizer (Chap­
    ter 1 l discussed Simon's satisficing as a blend of satisfying and
    maximizing)-research on happiness shows that those who live
 \ under a self-imposed pressure to be optimal in their enjoyment of
')f"things suffer a measure of distress.
       The difference between satisficers and optimizers raises a few
    questions.We know that people ofa happy disposition tend to be
    of the satisficing kind, with a set idea of what they want in life and
    an ability to stop upon gaining satisfaction.Their goals and desires
    do not move along with the experiences.They do not tend to ex-
                        P O S T S C R I PT   259


perience the internal treadmill effects of constantly trying to im­
prove on their consumption of goods by seeking higher and higher
levels of sophistication. In other words, they are neither avaricious
nor insatiable. An optimizer, by comparison, is the kind of person
who will uproot himself and change his official residence j ust to
reduce his tax bill by a few percentage points. (You would think
that the entire point of a higher income is to be free to choose
where to live; in fact it seems, for these people, wealth causes
them to increase their dependence!) Getting rich results in his
seeing flaws in the goods and services he buys. The coffee is not
warm enough. The cook no longer deserves the three stars given to
him by the Michelin guide (he will write to the editors). The table
is too far from the window. People who get promoted to impor­
tant positions usually suffer from tightness of schedules: Every­
thing has an allotted time. When they travel, everything is
"organized" with optimizing intent, including lunch at 1 2 :45 with
the president of the company (a table not too far from the win-
dow), the Stairmaster at 4 :40, and opera at 8:00.
                                                        .1F(!:
   Causality is not clear: The question remains whether optimiz­
ers are unhappy because they are constantly seeking a better deal
or if unhappy people tend to optimize out of their misery. In any
case, randomness seems to operate either as a cure or as Novocain!
   I am convinced that we are not made for clear-cut, well­
delineated schedules. We are made to live like firemen, with
downtime for lounging and meditating between calls, under the
protection of protective uncertainty. Regrettably, some people
might be involuntarily turned into optimizers, like a suburban
child having his weekend minutes squeezed between karate, gui­
tar lessons, and religious education. As I am writing these lines I
am on a slow train in the Alps, comfortably shielded from travel­
ing businesspersons. People around me are either students or re­
tired persons, or those who do not have "important appointments,"
hence not afraid of what they call wasted time. To go from Munich
to Milan, I picked the seven-and-a-half-hour train instead of the
                               260   PO S T S CR I PT


      plane, which no self-respecting businessperson would do on a
      weekday, and am enjoying an air unpolluted by persons squeezed
      by life.
         I came to this conclusion when, about a decade ago, I stopped
      using an alarm clock. I still woke up around the same time, but I
      followed my own personal clock.A dozen minutes of fuzziness
      and variability in my schedule made a considerable difference.
      True, there are some activities that require such dependability that
      an alarm clock is necessary, but I am free to choose a profession
      where I am not a slave to external pressure. Living like this, one
      can also go to bed early and not optimize one's schedule by
      squeezing every minute out of one's evening.At the limit, you can
     decide whether to be (relatively) poor, but free of your time, or
     rich but as dependent as a slave.
        It took me a while to figure out that we are not designed for
     schedules.The realization came when I recognized the difference
     between writing a paper and writing a book. Books are fun to
     write, papers are painful. I tend to find the activity of writing
     greatly entertaining, given that I do it without any external con­
     straint. You write, and may interrupt your activity, even in mid­
     sentence, the second it stops being attractive.After the success of
     this book, I was asked to write papers by the editors of a variety of
     professional and scientific journals.Then they asked me how long
     the piece should be.What? How long? For the first time in my life,
     I experienced a loss of pleasure in writing! Then I figured out a
     personal rule: For writing to be agreeable to me, the length of the
     piece needs to remain unpredictable. If I see the end of it, or if I am
     subjected to the shadow of an outline, I give up.I repeat that our
-¥,ancestors were not subjected to outlines, schedules, and adminis­
 . " trative deadlines.
        Another way to see the beastly aspect of schedules and rigid
     projections is to think in limit situations.Would you like to know
     with great precision the date of your death? Would you like to
                         POSTSCRIPT       261


know who committed the crime before the beginning of the
movie? Actually, wouldn't it be better if the length of movies were
kept a secret?

                    The Scrambling of Messages
Besides its effect on well-being, uncertainty presents tangible in­
formational benefits, particularly with the scrambling of poten­
tially damaging, and self-fulfilling, messages. Consider a currency
pegged by a central bank to a fixed rate.The bank's official policy
is to use its reserves to support it by buying and selling its currency
in the open market, a procedure called interoention.But should the
currency rate drop a tiny bit, people will immediately get the mes­
sage that the intervention failed to support the currency and that
the devaluation is coming.A pegged currency is not supposed to
fluctuate; the slightest downward fluctuation is meant to be a har­
binger of bad news] The rush to sell would cause a self-feeding
frenzy leading to certain devaluation.
   Now consider an environment where the central bank allows
some noise around the official band.It does not promise a fixed rate,
but one that can fluctuate a bit before the bank starts intervening.A
small drop would not be considered to bear much information.The
existence of noise leads us to avoid reading too much into varia­
tions. Fluctuat nee mergitur (it fluctuates but does not sink).
   This point has applications in evolutionary biology, evolution-


                                                                          .k . ,,,,,
ary game theory, and conflict situations.A mild degree of unpre­
dictability in your behavior can help you to protect yourself in _
                                                                    '"
situations of conflict.Say you always have the same threshold of V "\
reactions.You take a set level of abuse, say seventeen insulting re-
marks per week, before getting into a rage and punching the eigh-
teenth offender in the nose.Such predictability will allow people
to take advantage of you up to that well-known trigger point and
stop there. But if you randomize your trigger point, sometimes
overreacting at the slightest joke, people will not know in advance
                          262   P O S T S CR I PT


how far they can push you. The same applies to governments in
conflicts: They need to convince their adversaries that they are
crazy enough to sometimes overreact to a small peccadillo. Even
the magnitude of their reaction should be hard to foretell. Unpre­
dictability is a strong deterrent.


    T I-I IRD T I-I OUG I-I T: S TANDING ON ONE LEG

I have been periodically challenged to compress all this business of
randomness into a few sentences, so even an MBA can understand
it (surprisingly, MBAs, in spite of the insults, represent a significant
portion of my readership, simply because they think that my ideas
apply to other MBAs and not to them) .
    This brings to mind Rabbi Hillel's story, when he was asked by
someone particularly lazy if Hillel could teach him the Torah
while the student was standing on one leg.Rabbi Hillel's genius is
that he did not summarize; instead, he provided the core generator
of the idea, the axiomatic framework, which I paraphrase as fol­
lows: Don't do to others what you don't want them to do to you; the
rest is just commentary.
    It took me an entire lifetime to find out what my generator is.
It is: We favor the visible, the embedded, the personal, the narrated,
and the tangible; we scorn the abstract. Everything good (aesthetics,
ethics) and wrong (Fooled by Randomness) with us seems to flow
from it.
                 AC KNOWLEDGMENTS
                FOR TME FI RST EDI T ION




First, I would like to thank friends who can be considered rightful
coauthors. I am grateful to New York intellectual and expert in
randomness Stan Jonas (I do not know any other designation that
would do him justice) for half a lifetime of conversations into all
subjects bordering on probability with the animation and the zeal
of the neophyte. I thank my probabilist friend Don Geman (hus­
band of Helyette Geman, my thesis director) for his enthusiastic
support for my book; he also made me realize that probabilists are
born, not made-many mathematicians are capable of computing,
but not understanding, probability (they are no better than the
general population in exerting probabilistic judgments) .The real
book started with an all-night conversation with my erudite friend
Jamil Baz during the summer of 1987, as he discussed the forma­
tion of "new" and "old" money among families. I was then a bud­
ding trader and he scorned the arrogant Salomon Brothers traders
who surrounded him (he was proved right).He instilled in me the
voracious introspection about my performance in life and really
gave me the idea for this book. Both of us ended up getting doc­
torates later in life, on an almost identical subject matter.I have
also dragged many people on (very long) walks in New York, Lon­
don, or Paris, discussing some parts of this book, such as the late
Jimmy Powers, who helped nurture my trading early on, and who
      264   AC K N O W L ED G M E N T S F O R T H E F I R S T ED I T I O N


kept repeating "anyone can buy and sell," or my encyclopedic
friend David Pastel, equally at ease with literature, mathematics,
and Semitic languages. I have also engaged my lucid Popperian
colleague Jonathan Waxman in numerous conversations on the in­
tegration of Karl Popper's ideas into our life as traders.
    Second, I have been lucky to meet Myles Thompson and David
Wilson, when they both were at J. Wiley & Sons. Myles under­
stood that books need not be written to satisfy a predefined la­
beled audience, but that a book will find its own unique set of
readers-thus giving more credit to the reader than the off-the­
rack publisher. As to David, he believed enough in the book to
push me to take it into its natural course, free of all labels and tax­
onomies. David saw me the way I view myself: someone who has
a passion for probability and randomness, who is obsessed with lit­
erature but happens to be a trader, rather than a generic "expert."
He also saved my idiosyncratic style from the dulling of the edit­
ing process (for all its faults, the style is mine). Finally, Mina
Samuels proved to be the greatest conceivable editor: immensely
intuitive, cultured, aesthetically concerned, yet nonintrusive.
   Many friends have fed me with ideas during conversations,
ideas that found their way into the text. I can mention the usual
suspects, all of them prime conversationalists: Cynthia Shelton
Taleb, Helyette Geman, Marie-Christine Riachi, Paul Wilmott,
Shaiy Pilpel, David DeRosa, Eric Briys, Sid Kahn, Jim Gatheral,
Bernard Oppetit, Cyrus Pirasteh, Martin Mayer, Bruno Dupire,
Raphael Douady, Marco Avellaneda, Didier Javice, Neil Chriss,
and Philippe Asseily.
   Some of these chapters were composed and discussed as part of
the "Odeon Circle," as my friends and I met with a varying degree
of regularity (on Wednesdays at 1 0 p.m.after my Courant class) at
the bar of the restaurant Odeon in Tribeca. Genius loci ("the spirit
of the place") and outstanding Odeon staff member Tarek Khelifi
made sure that we were well taken care of and enforced our as-
      AC K N O W L E D G M E N T S != O R T H E l= I R S T E D I T I O N   2 65


siduity by making me feel guilty on no-shows, thus helping greatly
with the elaboration of the book. We owe him a lot.
   I must also acknowledge the people who read the MS, dili­
gently helped with the errors, or contributed to the elaboration of
the book with useful comments: Inge Ivchenko, Danny Tosto,
Manos Vourkoutiotis, Stan Metelits, Jack Rabinowitz, Silverio
Foresi, Achilles Venetoulias, and Nicholas Stephanou.Erik Stettler
was invaluable in his role as a shadow copy editor. All mistakes are
mine.
   Finally, many versions of this book sat on the Web, yielding spo­
radic (and random) bursts of letters of encouragement, correc­
tions, and valuable questions, which made me weave answers into
the text. Many chapters of this book came in response to readers'
questions. Francesco Corielli from Bocconi alerted me on the bi­
ases in the dissemination of scientific results.
   This book was written and finished after I founded Empirica,
my intellectual home, "Camp Empirica, " in the woods in the back
country of Greenwich, Connecticut, which I designed to fit my
taste and feel like a hobby: a combination of an applied probabil­
ity research laboratory, athletic summer camp, and, not least, a
trading operation (I had experienced one of my best professional
years while writing these lines) . I thank all the like-minded peo­
ple who helped fuel the stimulating atmosphere there: Pallop
Angsupun, Danny Tosto, Peter Halle, Mark Spitznagel, Yuzhao
Zhang, and Cyril de Lambilly as well as the members of Paloma
Partners such as Tom Witz, who challenged our wisdom on a daily
basis, and Donald Sussman, who supplied me with his penetrating
judgment.

I confess that, as a practitioner o f randomness, I focused primarily on the
defects of my own thinking (and that of a few people I 've observed or
tracked through time) . I also intended the book to be playful, which is not
very compatible with referencing every idea to some scientific paper to
give it a degree of respectability. I take the liberty in this section to finesse
a few points and to provide select references (of the "further reading" va­
riety)-but references linked to matters that I directly experienced. I re­
peat that this is a personal essay, not a treatise.
    On completion of this compilation I discovered the predominance of
matters relating to human nature (mostly empirical psychology) over
things mathematical. Sign of the times: I am convinced that the next edi­
tion, hopefully two years from now, will have plenty of references and
notes in neurobiology and neuroeconomics.

Clinical knowledge: The problem of clinicians not knowing what they do

on 'real understanding' is superior, is simply not justified by the facts to

means were equal to or better than clinical methods. Even worse: In a
later paper, he changed his mind about that one exception. Since Meehl's
work there has been a long tradition of examination of expert opinions,
confirming the same results. This problem applies to about every profes­
sion-particularly journalists and economists. We will discuss in further
notes the associated problem of self-knowledge.

Montaigne vs Descartes: I thank the artificial intelligence researcher and
omnivorous reader Peter McBurney for bringing to my attention the dis­
cussion in Toulmin ( 1 990) . On that I have to make the sad remark that
Descartes was originally a skeptic (as attested by his demon thought ex­
periment) but the so-called Cartesian mind corresponds to someone with
an appetite for certainties. Descartes' idea in its original form is that there
are very few certainties outside of narrowly defined deductive statements,
not that everything we think about needs to be deductive.

population can make such a mistake)

were "risk takers."

the part of journalists trying to justify their simplification. The television

Mathematics conflicts with probability: One is about certainties, the
other about the exact opposite. This explains the disrespect held by pure
mathematicians for the subject of probability for a long time-and the
difficulty in integrating the two. It is not until recently that it was termed
"the logic of science"-the title of the posthumous Jaynes (2003) . Inter­
estingly, this book is also perhaps the most complete account of the math­
ematics of the subject-he manages to use probability as an expansion of
conventional logic.
    The prominent mathematician David Mumford, a Fields medalist, re­
pents for his former scorn for probability. He writes in The Dawning of
the Age of Stochasticity (Mumford, 1 999) : "For over two millennia, Aristo­
tle's logic has ruled over the thinking of Western intellectuals. All precise
theories, all scientific models, even models of the process of thinking it­
self, have in principle conformed to the straight-jacket of logic. But from
its shady beginnings devising gambling strategies and counting corpses in
medieval London, probability theory and statistical inference now
emerge as better foundations for scientific models, especially those of the
process of thinking and as essential ingredients of theoretical mathemat­
ics, even the foundations of mathematics itself. We propose that this sea
change in our perspective will affect virtually all of mathematics in the
next century."

Courage or foolishness: For an examination of that notion of "courage"
and "guts," see Kahneman and Lovallo (1 993) . See also a discussion in

Rome in April 2003 (Kahneman, 2003).

Utopian/tragic: The essayist and prominent (scientific) intellectual
Steven Pinker popularized the distinction (originally attributable to the
political scholar Thomas Sowell) . See Sowell (1 987), Pinker (2002) . Ac­

from governments and that getting rid of government would be a great
panacea.

Fallibility and infallibilism: Peirce (in a prospectus for a never written

Relative compared to absolute position: See Kahneman, Knetsch and

his career thinking about the problem of status, rank, and relative income:
See Frank ( 1 985), and the very readable Frank ( 1 999) . The latter includes
discussions on the interesting proposer/responder problem where people
forego windfall profits in order to deprive others of a larger share. One
person proposes to the other a share of, say, $ 1 00. She can accept or re­
fuse. If she refuses, both get nothing.
   Even more vicious results have been shown by researchers who stud­

Zizzo and Oswald (200 1 ) . On that also, see Burnham (2003) (he ran an

Social emotions: D amasio (2003) : "One of the many reasons why people
become leaders and others followers, why so many command respect, has
little to do with knowledge or skills and a lot to do with how some phys­
ical traits and the manner of a given individual promote certain emotional
responses in others."

Literature on emotions: For a review of the current scientific ideas, see the
excellent comp act Evans (2002) . Evans belongs to the new breed of the

Elster (1 998) goes into the broad social implications of emotions. The
bestselling Goleman (1 995) offers a surprisingly complete account (the
fact that it is a bestseller is surprising: We are aware of our irrationality but
it does not seem to help) .

Fears built into our genes : This is not strictly true-genetic traits need to
be culturally activated. We are wired for some fears, such as fears of
snakes, but monkeys who have never seen a snake do not have it. They

Amnesia and risk avoidance: Damasio (2000) presents the case of David

Lewis, Amini and Lannon (2000) . Their book presents a pedagogic dis­
cussion of "camouflaged learning," in the form of implicit memory, as op­
posed to explicit memory (neocortical) . The book portrays memory as a
correlation in neuron connectivity rather than some CD-style recording­
which explains the revisions of memory by people after events.

Why don't we learn from our past history?: Two strains of literature. ( 1 )
The recent "stranger t o ourselves" line of research i n psychology (Wilson
2002) . (2) The literature on "immune neglect," Wilson, Meyers and
Gilbert (200 1 ) and Wilson, Gilbert and Centerbar (2003) . Literally, peo­
ple don't learn from their past reactions to good and bad things.

The dentist and prospect theory: Kahneman and Tversky ( 1 9 79) . In this
seminal discussion they present agents as interested in differences and
resetting their pain/pleasure level at zero as "anchor." The gist of it is
that "wealth" does not matter, almost only differences in wealth, since
                              276      NOTES


the resetting cancels the effect of the accumulation . Think of John hit­
ting wealth of $ 1 million from below or above and the impact on his
well-being. The difference between utility of wealth and utility of
changes in wealth is not trivial: It leads to dependence on the observa­
tion period. In fact the notion, taken to its limit, leads to the complete
revision of economic theory: Neoclassical economics will no longer be
useful beyond mathematical exercises. There have been vigorous such
discussions in the hedonistic literature as well: See Kahneman, Diener
and Schwarz (1 999) .

Language and probability: There is a very large connection between lan­
guage and probability; it has been studied by thinkers and scientists via
the sister methods of entropy and information theory-one can reduce
the dimensionality of a message by eliminating redundancy, for instance;
what is left is measured as information content (think of zipping a file)
and is linked to the notion of "entropy," which is the degree of disorder,
the unpredictable that is left. Entropy is a very invasive notion as it re­
lates to aesthetics and thermodynamics. See Campbell (1 982) for a lit­
erary presentation, and Cover and Thomas ( 1 9 9 1 ) for a scientific one,

The firehouse effect and the convergence of opinions: There are plenty of
discussions in the psychology literature of such convergence of opinions,
particularly in the area of mate selection or what Keynes calls "the beauty
contest," as people tend to choose what other people choose, causing pos­
itive-feedback loops.
    An interesting manifestation is the autokinetic effect. When people
gaze at a stationary light in a room they see it moving after a while and
can estimate the amount of movement, not knowing that it is an optical
illusion. When isolated the subjects give wildly varying speeds of move­
ment; when tested in a group they converge to a common speed of move­
ment: See Plotkin (1 998) . Sornette (2003) gives an interesting account of
the feedback loops that result from herding written in light, but with ex­
tremely intuitive mathematics.

Evolution and small probabilities: Evolution is principally a probabilistic
concept. Can it be fooled by randomness? Can the least skilled survive?
There is a prevalent strain of Darwinism, called naive Darwinism, that be­
lieves that any species or member of a species that dominates at any point
has been selected by evolution because they have an advantage over oth­
ers. This results from a common misunderstanding of local and global op­
tima, mixed with an inability to get rid of the belief in the law of small
numbers (overinference from small data sets) . Just put two people in a
random environment, say a gambling casino, for a weekend. One of them
will fare better than the other. To a naive observer the one who fares bet­
ter will have a survival advantage over the other. If he is taller or has some
trait that distinguishes him from the other, such trait will be identified by
                                278    N O T ES


the naive observer as the explanation of the difference in fitness. Some
people do it with traders-make them compete in a formal competition.
Consider also the naive evolutionary thinking positing the "optimality" of
selection-the founder of sociobiology does not agree with such optimal­
ity when it comes to rare events: E. 0. Wilson (2002) writes: "The human
brain evidently evolved to commit itself emotionally only to a small piece
of geography, a limited band of kinsmen, and two or three generations
into the future. To look neither far ahead nor far afield is elemental in a
Darwinian sense. We are innately inclined to ignore any distant possibility
not yet requiring examination. It is, people say, just good common sense. Why
do they think in this shortsighted way? "The reason is simple: It is a hard­
wired part of our Paleolithic heritage. For hundreds of millennia, those
who worked for short-term gain within a small circle of relatives and
friends lived longer and left more offspring-even when their collective
striving caused their chiefdoms and empires to crumble around them . The
long view that might have saved their distant descendants required a vi­
sion and extended altruism instinctively difficult to marshal."
    See also Miller (2000) : "Evolution h�s no foresight. It lacks the long­
term vision of drug company management. A species can't raise venture
capital to pay its bills while its research team . . . Each species has to stay
biologically profitable every generation, or else it goes extinct. Species al­
ways have cashflow problems that prohibit speculative investments in
their future. More to the point, every gene underlying every potential in­
novation has to yield higher evolutionary payoffs than competing genes,
or it will disappear before the innovation evolves any further. This makes
it hard to explain innovations."

Fooled by negative skewness: The first hint of an explanation for the
popularity of negatively skewed payoffs comes from the early literature
on behavior under uncertainty, with the "small number problem." Tver­
sky and Kahneman ( 1 9 7 1 ) write: "We submit that people view a sample
randomly drawn from a population as highly representative, that is, sim­
ilar to a population in all essential characteristics." The consequence is
                                  NOTES    279


the inductive fallacy: overconfidence in the ability to infer general prop­
erties from observed facts, "undue confidence in early trends," the stabil­
ity of observed patterns and deriving conclusions with more confidence
attached to them than can be warranted by the data . Worst, the agent
finds causal explanations or perhaps distributional attributes that con­
firm his undue generalization. It is easy to see that the "small numbers"
get exacerbated with skewness since most of the time the observed mean
will be different from the true mean and most of the time the observed
variance will be lower than the true one. Now consider that it is a fact
that in life, unlike a laboratory or a casino, we do not observe the proba­
bility distribution from which random variables are drawn: We only see
the realizations of these random processes. It would be nice if we could,
but it remains that we do not measure probabilities as we would mea­
sure the temperature or the height of a person. This means that when we
compute probahilities from past data we are making assumptions about
the skewness of the generator of the random series-all data is condi­
tional upon a generator. In short, with skewed packages, the camouflage
of the properties comes into play and we tend to believe what we see.

Goodman's riddle of induction: One can take the issue of induction
into a more difficult territory with the following riddle. Say the market
went up every day for a month . For many people of inductive taste it
could confirm the theory that it is going up every day. But consider: It
                               280    N O T ES


may confirm the theory that it goes up every day then crashes-what we
are witnessing is not an ascending market but one that ascends then
crashes. When one observes a blue obj ect it is possible to say that one is
observing something blue until time t, beyond which it is green-that
such object is not blue but "grue." Accordingly, by such logic, the fact
that the market went up all this time may confirm that it will crash to­
morrow! It confirms that we are observing a rising-crashing market. See

Equity premium puzzle: There is an active academic discussion of the "eq­

Very little consideration was given to the possibility that the premium
may have been an optical illusion owing to the survivorship bias-or that
the process may include the occurrence of black swans. The discussion
seems to have calmed a bit after the declines in the equity markets after
the events of 2000-2002.

Differences between returns: See Arnbarish and Siegel ( 1 996) . The dull
presenter was actually comparing "Sharpe ratios," i.e., returns scaled by their
standard deviations (both annualized), named after the financial economist
William Sharpe, but the concept has been commonly used in statistics and
called "coefficient of variation." (Sharpe introduced the concept in the con­
text of the normative theory of asset pricing to compute the expected port­
folio returns given some risk profile, not as a statistical device.) Not
counting the survivorship bias, over a given twelve-month period, assuming
(very generously) the Gaussian distribution, the "Sharpe ratio" differences
for two uncorrelated managers would exceed 1 .8 with close to 50% proba­
bility. The speaker was discussing "Sharpe ratio" differences of around . 1 5!
Even assuming a five-year observation window, something very rare with
hedge fund managers, things do not get much better.

tailed and saying that the probability distribution is different from the
one we learned in Finance 1 0 1 . He studies the transition points: Say a
book's sales become close to a critical point from which they will
                                282     N O TES


really take off Their dynamics, conditional on past growth, become
predictable.

The Tipping Point: Gladwell (2000) . In the article that preceded the book
(Gladwell, 1 996) he writes: "The reason this seems surprising is that human
beings prefer to think in linear terms. . . . I can remember struggling with
these same theoretical questions as a child, when I tried to pour ketchup on
my dinner. Like all children encountering this problem for the first time, I
assumed that the solution was linear: That steadily increasing hits on the
base of the bottle would yield steadily increasing amounts of ketchup out
the other end. Not so, my father said, and he recited a ditty that, for me, re­
mains the most concise statement of the fundamental nonlinearity of
everyday life: 'Tomato ketchup in a bottle-None will come and then the
lot'll.' "

Pareto: Before we had a generalized use of the bell curve, we took the
ideas of Pareto with his distribution more seriously-its mark is the con­
tribution of large deviations to the overall properties. Later elaborations
led to the so-called Pareto-Levy or Levy-Stable distributions with (out­
side of special cases) some quite vicious properties (no known error rate) .
The reasons economists never liked to use it is that it does not offer
tractable properties-economists like to write papers in which they offer
the illusion of solutions, particularly in the form of mathematical answers.
A Pareto-Levy distribution does not provide them with such luxury. For
economic discussions on the ideas of Pareto, see Zajdenweber (2000),
Bouvier (1 999) . For a presentation of the mathematics of Pareto-Levy dis­
tributions, see Voit (200 1 ), and Mandelbrot (1 997) . There is a recent re­
discovery of power law dynamics. Intuitively a power law distribution has
the following property: If the power exponent were 2, then there would
be 4 times more people with an income higher than $1 million than peo­
ple with $2 million. The effect is that there is a very small probability of
having an event of an extremely large deviation. More generally given a
deviation x, the incidence of a deviation of a multiple of x will be that
multiple to a given power exponent. The higher the exponent the lower
the probability of a large deviation.

Don't take "correlation" and those who use the word seriously: The
same "A." of the lighter-throwing variety taught me a bit about the fal­
lacy of the notion of correlation . "You do not seem to be correlated to
anything" is the most common blame I've received when carrying my
strategy of shooting for rare events. The following example might illus­
trate it. A nonlinear trading instrument, such as a put, will be positively
correlated to the underlying security over many sample paths (say the
put expires worthless in a bear market as the market did not drop
enough), except of course upon becoming in the money and crossing
the strike, in which case the correlation reverses with a vengeance. The
reader should do himself a favor by not taking the notion of correlation
seriously except in very narrow matters where linearity is justified.

Discussion of "rationality": The concept is not so easy to handle. As the
concept has been investigated in plenty of fields, it has been developed
the most by economists as a normative theory of choice. Why did the
economists develop such an interest in it? The basis of economic analy­
sis is a concept of human nature and rationality embodied in the notion
of homo economicus. The characteristics and behavior of such homo eco­
nomicus are built into the postulates of consumer choice and include
nonsatiation (more is always preferred to less) and transitivity (global
consistency in choice) . For instance, Arrow (1 987) writes, "It is note­
worthy that the everyday usage of the term 'rationality' does not corre­
spond to the economist's definition as transitivity and completeness,
that is maximization of something. The common understanding is in­
stead the complete exploitation of information, sound reasoning, and so
forth."

Perhaps the best way to see it for an economist is the maximization lead­
ing to a unique solution.
                               284     N O T ES


Even then, it is not easy. Who is maximizing what? To begin, there is a
conflict between collective and individual rationality ("tragedy of the
commons" seen by Keynes in his parable of the stadium where one's opti­
mal strategy is to stand up, but collectively the optimal strategy is for
everyone to remain seated} . Another problem is seen in Arrow's voter's
impossibility theorem. Consider also the following voter problem : People
vote but the probability adjusted gains from voting can be less than the ef­
fort expended in going to the polling place. See Luce and Raiffa ( 1 9 5 7}
for a discussion of these paradoxes.

Note that the literature on rational choice under uncertainty is very ex­
tensive, cutting across fields, from evolutionary game theory to political
science. But as John Harsanyi put it bluntly, It is nonnative, and meant to
be so. This is a heroic statement: Saying that economics has abandoned its
scientific pretensions and accepted that it does not describe how people
do act but rather how they should act. It means that it, has entered the
realm of something else: philosophy (though not quite ethics} . As such, an
individual can accept it fully and should aim to act like the neoclassical
man. If he can.

Ultimate/proximate as a solution to some rationality problems: Evolu­
tionary theorists distinguish between proximate and ultimate cause.

Proximate cause: I eat because I am hungry.
Ultimate cause : If I didn't have an incentive to eat I would have gracefully
exited the gene pool.

   Now, if one invokes ultimate causes, plenty of behavior deemed lo­
cally irrational (like the voter problem above} can be interpreted as ra­
tional. It explains altruism: Why would you take a small risk to help a
stranger from drowning? Visibly this impetus to help put us where we
are today.
   See Dawkins ( 1 989, 1 9 76) and Pinker (2002) for additional insights
on the difference.

Birth of the neurobiology of rationality: Berridge (2003) introduces a
neurobiological dimension to rationality using two of Daniel Kahneman's
four utilities (the experienced, remembered, predicted, and decision util­
ities) and setting irrationality if the decision utility exceeds the predicted
one. There is a neural dimension to such irrationality: dopamine activity in
the mesolimbic brain .

Evolutionary psychology/sociobiology: The most readable is Burnham and
Phelan (2000) . See Kreps and Davies (1 993) for the general framework of
ecology as optimization. See also Wilson (E. 0., 2000), Winston (2002), the
cartoons of Evans and Zarate (1 999), Pinker (1 997), and Burnham (1 997).

Modularity: For the seminal work, see Fodor (1 983) in philosophy and
cognitive science, Cosmides and Tooby (1 992) in evolutionary psychology.

The Wason selection task (written about in nearly every book on evolu­
tionary psychology) is as follows. Consider the following two tests:

Problem 1 : Suppose that I have a pack of cards, each of which has a letter
written on one side and a number written on the other side. Suppose in
addition that I claim that the following rule is true: If a card has a vowel
on one side, then it has an even number on the other side. Imagine that I now
show you four cards from the pack: E 6 K 9. Which card or cards should
you turn over in order to decide whether the rule is true or false?
                                286   NOTES


Problem 2 : You are a bartender in a town where the legal age for drinking
is twenty-one and feel responsible for the violations of the rules. You are
confronted with the following situations and would have to ask the pa­
tron to show you either his age or what he is drinking. Which of the four
patrons would you have to question ?

1 , drinking beer; 2, over twenty-one; 3, drinking Coke; 4, under 2 1 .

While the two problems are identical (it is clear that you need to check
only the first and last of the four cases) the majority of the population gets
the first one wrong and the second one right. Evolutionary psychologists
believe that the defects in solving the first problem and ease in the second
show evidence of a cheater detection module-just consider that we
adapted to the enforcement of cooperative tasks and are quick at identi­
fying free riders.

Criteria of modularity: I borrow from the linguist Elisabeth Bates' pres­
entation (Bates, 1 994) of Fodor's nine criteria of modularity (ironically
Bates is a skeptic on the subject) . The information-processing criteria are:
encapsulation ( we cannot interfere with the functioning of a module) , un­
consciousness, speed (that's the point of the module), shallow outputs
(we have no idea of the intermediate steps), and obligatory firing (a mod­
ule generates predetermined outputs for predetermined inputs) . The bio­
logical criteria that distinguish them from learned habits are: ontogenetic
universals (they develop in characteristic sequence), localization (they use
dedicated neural systems), and pathological universals (modules have
characteristic pathologies across populations). Finally, modularity's most
important property is its domain specificity.

Books on the physical brain: For the hierarchy reptilian/limbidneocorti­
cal, see causal descriptions in Ratey (200 1 ), Ramachandran and Blakeslee
( 1 998), Carter ( 1 999), Carter (2002), Conlan ( 1 999), Lewis, Amini, and
Lannon (2000), and Goleman (1 995) .

Emotional Brain: Damasio (1 994) and LeDoux ( 1 998) . Bechara, Dama­
sio, Damasion, and Tranel ( 1 994) show the degradation of the risk­
avoidance behavior of patients with damage in their ventromedial frontal
cortex, a part of the brain that links us to our emotions. Emotions seem
to play a critical role both ways. For the new field of neuroeconomics, see

(2003).

Sensitivity to losses: Note that losses matter more than gains, but you be­
come rapidly desensitized to them (a loss of $ 1 0,000 is better than ten
losses of $ 1 ,000) . Gains matter less than losses, and large gains even less
(ten gains of $ 1 ,000 are better than one gain of $ 1 0, 000) .

Hedonic treadmill: My late friend Jimmy Powers used to go out of his way
to show· me very wealthy investment bankers acting miserably after a bad
day. How good is all this wealth for them if they adjust to it to such a point
that a single bad day can annihilate the effect of all these p ast successes? If
things do not accumulate well then it follows that humans should follow a
different set of strategies. This "resetting" shows the link to prospect theory.

Debate: Gigerenzer (1 996), Kahneman and Tversky (1 996), and
Stanovich and West (2000) . The evolutionary theorists are deemed to
hold a Panglossian view: Evolution solves everything. Strangely, the debate
is bitter not because of large divergences of opinions but because of small
ones. Simple Heuristics That Make Us Smart is the title of a compilation of
articles by Gigerenzer and his peers (Gigerenzer, 2000) . See also Gigeren­
zer, Czerlinski and Martignon (2002).

Medical example: Bennett ( 1 998) . It is also discussed in Gigerenzer,
Czerlinski and Martignon (2002). The heuristics and biases catalogue it as
the base rate fallacy. The evolutionary theorists split into domain general
(unconditional probability) as opposed to domain specific (conditional) .

Behavioral finance: See Schleifer (2000) and Shefrin (2000) for a review.
See also Thaler ( 1 9946) and the original Thaler (1 994a) .

Domain-specific adaptations: Our lungs are a domain-specific adaptation
meant to exi:ract oxygen from the air and deposit it into our blood; they
are not meant to circulate blood. For evolutionary psychologists the same
applies to psychological adaptations.

Opaque process: For psychologists in the heuristics and biases tradition,
System 1 is opaque, that is, not self-aware. This resembles the encapsula­
tion and unconsciousness of modules discussed earlier.

ways.

Underestimation of possible outcomes: Hilton (2003).

The neurobiology of eye contact: Ramachandran and Blakeslee ( 1 998) on
the visual centers that proj ect to the amygdala: "Scientists recording cell
responses in the amygdala found that, in addition to responding to facial
expressions and emotions, the cells also respond to the direction of eye
gaze. For instance, one cell may fire if another person is looking directly at
you, whereas a neighboring cell will fire only if that person's gaze is
averted by a fraction of an inch. Still other cells fire when the gaze is way
off to the left or the right. This phenomenon is not surprising given the
important role that gaze direction plays in primate social communica­
tions-the averted gaze of guilt, shame or embarrassment; the intense, di­
rect gaze of a lover, or the threatening stare of an enemy."

The conventional probability paradigm: Most of the conventional discus­
sions on probabilistic thought, especially in the philosophical literature,
present minor variants of the same paradigm with the succession of the fol­
lowing historical contributions: Chevalier de Mere, Pascal, Cardano, De
Moivre, Gauss, Bernouilli, Laplace, B ayes, von Mises, Carnap, Kolmogorov,
Borel, De Finetti, Ramsey, etc. However, these concern the problems of cal­
culus of probability, perhaps fraught with technical problems, but ones that
are hair-splitting and, to be derogatory, academic. They are not of much con­
cern in this book-because, in spite of my specialty, they do not seem to pro­
vide any remote usefulness for practical matters. For a review of these, I refer
the reader to Gillies (2000), Von Plato (I 994), Hacking ( 1 990), or the more
popular and immensely readable Against the Gods (Bernstein, 1 996), itself
drawing heavily on Florence Nightingale David (David, 1 962). I recommend
Bernstein's Against the Gods as a readable presentation of the history of
probabilistic thought in engineering and the applied hard sciences but com­
pletely disagree with its message on the measurability of risks in the social
sciences.
   I repeat the point: To philosophers operating in prob ability per se, the
problem seems one of calculus. In this book the problem of probability is
largely a m atter of knowledge, not one of computation. I consider these
computations a mere footnote to the subject. The real problem is: Where
do we get the probability from? How do we change our beliefs? I have
been working on the "gambling with the wrong dice" problem: It is far
more important to figure out what dice we are using when gambling than
to develop sophisticated computations of outcomes and run the risk of
h aving, say, dice with nothing but 6s. In economics, for instance, we have
very large models of risk calculations sitting on very rickety assumptions
(actually, not rickety but plain wrong) . They smoke us with math, but
everything else is wrong. Getting the right assumptions may matter more
than having a sophisticated model.
   An interesting problem is the "value at risk" issue where people imag­
ine that they h ave a way to understand the risk using "complicated math­
ematics" and running predictions on rare events-thinking that they
were able from p ast data to observe the probability distributions. The
most interesting behavioral aspect is that those who advocate it do not
                                  290   NOTES


seem to have tested their past predicting record, another Meehl type of
problem.

Thinkers and philosophers of probability: Perhaps the most insightful
book ever written on the subject remains the great John Maynard
Keynes' Treatise on Probability (Keynes, 1 989, 1 920), which surprisingly
has not collected dust-somehow everything we seem to discover ap­
pears to have been said in it (though, characteristic of Keynes, in a con­
voluted way) . In the usual supplied lists of thinkers of probability,
Shackle, who refined subjective probability, is often undeservedly absent
(Shackle, 1 9 73). Most authors also omit the relevant contributions of
Isaac Levi on subjective probability and its links to belief (Levi, 1 970) ,
which should be required reading in that area (it is impenetrable but is
worth the exercise) . It is a shame because Isaac Levi is a probability
thinker (as opposed to probability calculator) . The epistemologist of
probability Henry Kyburg (Kyburg, 1 983) is also absent (too difficult to
read) .
    One observation about philosophers as compared to scientists is that
they do seem to work in a very heterogeneous and compartmented man­
ner: Probability in philosophy is dealt with in different branches: logic,
epistemology, rational choice, philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of
science. It is surprising to see Nicholas Rescher delivering an insightful
presidential address of the American Philosophical Association on the
topic of luck (later published as a book called Luck, see Rescher, 1 995)
without discussing much of the problems in the philosophical and cogni­
tive literature on probability.

Problems with my message: Note that many readers in the technical pro­
fessions, say engineering, exhibited some difficulty seeing the connection
between probability and belief and the importance of skepticism in risk
management.

Looks and success: See (Shahami, et. al., 1 993; Hosoda et. al., 1 999) . My
friend Peter Bevelin wrote to me: "When I'm thinking about misjudgment
of personalities I am always reminded of Sherlock Holmes in Arthur
Conan Doyle's The Sign of Four. "It is of the first importance not to allow
your judgment to be biased by personal qualities. I assure you that the
most winning woman I ever knew was hanged for poisoning three little
children for their insurance-money, and the most repellent man of my ac­
quaintance is a philanthropist who has spent nearly a quarter of a million
upon the London poor."

Maximizing: Psychology literature has focused on maximizing in terms of
choice, not so much in these terms of actual optimization . I go beyond by
looking at the activity of optimization in daily life. For a synthesis and re­
view of the hedonic impact of maximizing and why "less is more," see
Schwartz (2003). See also Schwartz, et. al. (2002) . For the causal link be­
tween unhappiness and the pursuit of material benefits, see Kasser
(2002) .

Date of your death: I owe this last point to Gerd Gigerenzer.

Unpredictable behavior: See Miller (2000) for the discussion of the point

                       ABOUT THE AUTHOR


NASSIM NICHOLAS TALEB is a literary essayist and mathematical
trader obsessed with the multidisciplinary problems of uncer­
tainty. His interests lie at the juncture of philosophy, mathematics,
finance, and the social sciences, but he has stayed extremely close
to the ground thanks to an uninterrupted two-decade career as a
quantitative trader in New York and London.
   Taleb is the Dean's Professor in the Sciences of Uncertainty at
the Isenberg School of Management of the University of Massa­
chusetts at Amherst. He previously taught at the Courant Institute
of Mathematical Sciences of New York University. His degrees in­
clude an MBA from the Wharton School and a Ph .D. from the
University of Paris.
   In addition to his scientific and literary interests, Taleb 's hobby
is to poke fun at those who take themselves and the quality of their
knowledge too seriously. His work has been published in seventeen
languages (even French) . He lives mostly in New York.

berg for the Typefoundry Berlingska Sti!gjuteri AB in Lund, Swe­

clined serifs make it highly legible.

  ·rFinally, i9 paperback, here is the word-of-mouth sensation that will change
 ·. the w;y you think about business and the world. This book is about luck:
    more precisely, about how we perceive luck in our personal and profes­
    sional experiences. Set against the backdrop of the. most conspicuous.forum
    in which luck is mistaken for skill-the markets-Fooled by Randomness
    is an irreverent, iconoclastic, eye-opening, a_nd endlessly entertaining mul­
    tidisciplinary exploration of one of the least understood forces in all of
. -our lives.
